# Curriculum Engineer

## Public Position Details

Want to work on open source full-time and bring coding clubs to high schoolers around the world? Hack Club is hiring a curriculum engineer to build out our open-source club curriculum.

The ideal candidate has experience building technical curriculum for beginners, is actively involved in the open source community, has professional experience as an engineer (or the open source equivalent), and is already involved in getting more people coding (whether through hackathons, meetups, or something else).

Comment or shoot me an email at zach@hackclub.com with something you've learned recently if you're interested :-).

## Internal Details

Really, we're looking for someone that can own our curriculum. That means setting its direction, executing on that, and managing the rest of the team to make it happen. Ideally this person has experience building curriculum and working with a lot of ambiguity (like at an early stage startup).

Obviously, they should be [the type of person we want to hire](README.md#what-type-of-people-do-we-want-to-hire).
