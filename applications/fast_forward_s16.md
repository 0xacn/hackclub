### About Hack Club

**Product - What are you building?**

Hack Club helps high school students start coding clubs. We provide prospective club
leaders with open-source materials for starting clubs and with a supportive community
of leaders around the globe. Our club playbook contains facilitation guidelines and 
workshops that focus on shipping cool projects in <60 minutes 
(ex. https://git.io/vCsTC).

Our goal is to provide every student, regardless of ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic 
status, the opportunity to experience the joys of hacking because we believe coding is 
one of the most empowering things someone can learn. If we're able to accomplish this, 
not only does that mean a larger and more diverse technology workforce, but it means 
living in a more empowered world where more people create the change they want to see.
And that is a world we want to live in.

**Who we are - How did the founders meet and how long have you been working together?
How do you delineate your roles and responsibilities? Why did you choose to work 
together?**

The founders have known each other since September 2014 (18 months) and have been 
living together since November 2014 (16 months). We met after a mutual friend 
introduced Zach, who had just won PennApps, the University of Pennsylvania's hackathon,
to Jonathan, who was a former lead organizer of PennApps.

**Why we're doing this - Why are you pursuing this particular idea? Do you have domain
expertise in it? Have you tested it with customers? What unique insights or belief(s) 
do you have about this market?**

When Zach was in high school he wanted a community where he could build things with 
others, so he started a coding club. By the club's second year, he and his classmates 
did things they didn't previously believe were possible: they launched games on the 
Play Store, won high-profile hackathons, and founded a web design firm. 

However, the club was not without its problems. After meeting other high school students
who started clubs and ran into similar issues, he started Hack Club to fix them.
