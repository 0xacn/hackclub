hackEDU:

##### Where do you, or your team, need the most support right now?

_Full question: **Where do you, or your team, need the most support right now?
Be specific and we'll try to help where we can.**_

We're currently raising $150k to bring us through the year, but my cofounder
and I are completely new to nonprofit fundraising and are both shooting in the
dark with more things than we'd like. Specifically, introductions to people who
have (1) closed large corporate sponsors, (2) extensive experience writing
grants, or (3) experience closing foundations would be particularly useful.

We're also figuring out our fiscal sponsorship situation so we can accept
donations and access to an attorney who has experience with nonprofit fiscal
sponsorships would probably save us lots of time and trouble down the road.

##### Anything else you'd like to share?

I've been spending some of my (extremely limited) free time learning Rust
(https://www.rust-lang.org/). It's really quite cool and has a very interesting
way of approaching generics and memory management.
