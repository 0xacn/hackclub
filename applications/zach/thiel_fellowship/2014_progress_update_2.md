##### Where do you, or your team, need the most support right now?

_Full question: **Where do you, or your team, need the most support right now?
Be specific and we'll try to help where we can.**_

Our primary focus right now is fundraising so we can continue building hackEDU.
Introductions to individuals or foundations that might be interested in
contributing would be _amazing_. We're currently focusing on private donors,
but starting to build relationships with foundations now would be helpful down
the line.

##### Anything else you'd like to share?

As mentioned in my last update, I've been spending some of my (extremely

cool and has a very interesting way of approaching generics and memory
management.
