### Please tell us about yourself

I am the founder of hackEDU, a nonprofit dedicated to helping high school
students start programming clubs. My previous employers include Yo, where I
built the backend architecture for an app with over 3 million users, and Run
Games, where I helped develop our flagship game, Football Heroes, and grew it
to over a million users. I spend my spare time attending weekend hackathons
and learning new programming languages.

I started programming in the third grade when my friends and I built a website
about Club Penguin, a video game that we all played. Learning to program made
me realize that I can do anything or become anyone I want to be. That feeling
of agency has helped define who I am today.

I believe that hackers, people who create what they see missing in the world
and aren't afraid to break the rules, are the people who will solve the world's
biggest problems and I see it as my duty to give everyone the chance at
becoming a hacker. I believe that everyone, regardless of race, gender, or
socioeconomic status, deserves a fair chance at learning computer
programming and becoming a hacker.

### What is your talk idea about?

I'd like to speak about programming, how it affects agency, and show students
that anyone can learn to build things.

### How does your talk idea relate to our theme, "Simply Irresistible"?

Programming itself is deceptively simple--logical expressions written in text
with correct syntax and grammar--but the implications of it are enormous. I
believe that programming is the best tool to inspire agency in others, and I'm
on a mission to bring it to as many others as possible.

Programming is irresistible for the same reason the first successful airplanes
were: it's an unintuitive solution to a very ambitious problem. DaVinci's
first airplane design had flapping wings to propel itself. It took hundreds of
years and the discovery of fluid dynamics for Sir George Cayley to invent the
fixed-wing aircraft, an unintuitive solution to the ambitious problem of flight.
I believe that programming is the fixed-wing aircraft for inspiring agency in
the next generation.

### Write 3 words that best describe you, what you do, or what you care about

- Hacker
- Agency
- Pragmatic

### What should we know about you that we didn't ask?

I get ridiculously excited when building things.

It's not uncommon to find me nerding out late at night learning a new
programming language (Rust is what's kept me busy recently
http://www.rust-lang.org/) or building a tool for myself.

While I mentioned hackathons (12-48 hour coding competitions) in my personal
summary, I didn't mention how much of a role they play in my life. In the past
year alone I've been to over 20 hackathons and, since late January 2015, I've
been at one every weekend. Through hackathons I've made nearly all of my
friends and gotten integrated into the technology industry.
