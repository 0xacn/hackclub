# Hacker Stories

Crowd-sourced hacker stories from clubs. Hackers could submit stories of what
they made (don't have to be long). Over time we'd have a compendium of stories,
books of inspiration, encouragement, and proof of outcomes of
hackEDU. Something between testimonials and "look what we came up with!". Tales
of blood, sweat, tears, and camaraderie of the hacker ethos.

Perhaps we could work with Medium (or just have everyone write up blog posts on
Medium as the stories, see
https://medium.com/@liezl200/college-a-new-perspective-ec866a97f13).

Could pair this with shipped to build really great community excitement about
shipping things. Ex. shipped projects could have stories attached with them, all
of them are tweeted and shared on Facebook. Awesome stuff.
