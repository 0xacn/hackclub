##### What our hackers have been up to

At the top two collegiate hackathons in the world, [PennApps
X](http://2014f.pennapps.com/) and [MHacks
V](http://mhacksv.challengepost.com/), half of the six winning teams were led
high school students. All of these winning high school teams are part of
hackEDU.

Most recently, [Rohith Varanasi](http://rohithvaranasi.com/), one of our club
leaders from South Brunswick High School, and the rest of his team from [MHacks

Another one of our leaders, [Raphael Kats](http://raphaelrk.com/), created
