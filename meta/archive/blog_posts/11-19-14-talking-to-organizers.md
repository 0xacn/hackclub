# Talking to Organizers

**Primary takeaway. Our club organizers are awesome!**

We realize that the most important part of our organization is our organizers.
We took today to talk to existing organizers and reestablish relationships with
those we haven't actively been in contact with.

Here are some of the things that we've learned from them:

- Many of the found us through Google. Google rocks. Optimizing for SEO is
  super important! #todo Check to see how many people got referred from each
  incoming traffic source. #todo do SEO better
- Having heterogeneous grouping which can be enabled by splitting work seems to
  be a good model. 
- Being explicit, authentic, and transparent to everyone about what hackEDU is
  about and the commitment that is expected may be a good strategy.
- Embedding awesome culture of say, epic hackathons with lots of fun, cupcakes,
  and candy. 
- Providing training how how to run a club and facilitate the experience,
  training the trainers, seems to be a good idea.
  - Provide training on how to make a club awesome, not curriculum.
  - This probably best done through modeling it through immersive in-person
    gatherings, say right before a hackathon when people are geographically
    proximal.
    - Could be something along the lines of a far less formal
      [Hackcon](https://news.mlh.io/hackcon-talks-03-31-2014) or the Learner
      Hacker's Retreat.
- There is a wide gulf between organizers who understand who learning happens
  and those who do not.

In conclusion, we value sleep. Good night.

Much love,
