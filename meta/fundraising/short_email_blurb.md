We've built hackEDU, a non-profit community of programming clubs with 1,300
students at 38 high schools around the country. We think it's silly that
students who love music can join band, students who love sports can join an
athletic team, but students who want to learn to code have to go home and code
alone. Our vision is that every high school in the country will offer
programming clubs where students can build things (and learn to build things)
with other like-minded students. At MHacks V and PennApps X, the two largest
collegiate hackathons with >1000 attendees flown in from schools including
Stanford, MIT, Harvard, and ETH Zurich, half of the winning teams were led by
high school students, all of whom are part of their local hackEDU chapter.
