We've built hackEDU, a non-profit community of programming clubs with 1,300
students at 38 high schools around the country. We think it's silly that
students who love music can join band, students who love sports can join an
athletic team, but students who want to learn to code have to go home and code
alone. Our vision is that every high school in the country will offer
programming clubs where students can build things (and learn to build things)
with other like-minded students. At MHacks V and PennApps X, the two largest
collegiate hackathons with >1000 attendees flown in from schools including
Stanford, MIT, Harvard, and ETH Zurich, half of the winning teams were led by
high school students, all of whom are part of their local hackEDU chapter.

hackEDU is a non-profit initiative that has grown a community of coding clubs with 1,300
students in 38 high schools across 11 states and 2 countries. Our mission is that every high school will offer coding clubs where students can learn and build things together. Our vision is to empower high school students to create what they see missing in the world and not be afraid to break the rules. Our members have started their own companies, opened a non-profit coding camp for middle school girls, and at the top two collegiate hackathons in the world, MHacks V and PennApps X, hackEDU members made up 50% of the top 3 winning teams.
