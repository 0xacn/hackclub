We've built hackEDU, a community of programming clubs with 1,000 students at 24
high schools around the country. We think it's silly that students who love
music can join band, students who love sports can join an athletic team, but
students who want to learn to code have to go home and code alone. Our vision
is that every high school in the country will offer programming clubs where
students can code (and learn to code) with other like-minded students.
