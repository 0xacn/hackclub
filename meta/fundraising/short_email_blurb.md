[hackEDU](https://hackedu.us) is building a national nonprofit that brings
coding clubs to high schools nationwide. Students who love music can join band;
students who love sports can join an athletic team; but students who want to
code have had to go home and do it alone â€“ until now.
 
**Key stats:**

- In 7 months we're in 40 schools across 11 states and reaching 1,300 high
  school students.
  - 32% of constituency is female (nearly 2x national high school average)
  - 37% of constituency is black/Hispanic (7x industry average)
  - 12 of our 40 schools have a majority of students on free or reduced lunch

hackEDU is a non-profit initiative that has grown a community of coding clubs
with 1,300 students in 38 high schools across 11 states and 2 countries. Our
mission is that every high school will offer coding clubs where students can
learn and build things together. Our vision is to empower high school students
to create what they see missing in the world and not be afraid to break the
rules. Our members have started their own companies, opened a non-profit coding
camp for middle school girls, and at the top two collegiate hackathons in the
world, MHacks V and PennApps X, hackEDU members made up 50% of the top 3 winning
teams.
