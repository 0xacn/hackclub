Hey [name],

Hope all is well with you! [sentence about product] and I'm _floored_ by the
product. [product name] is awesome!

We're building hackEDU, a community of programming clubs with 1,300 students at
38 high schools around the country. We think it's silly that students who love
music can join band, students who love sports can join an athletic team, but
students who want to learn to code have to go home and code alone. Our vision
is that every high school in the country will offer programming clubs where
students can code (and learn to code) with other like-minded students.

I'm wondering if you'd be interested in donating [product] to us as an in-kind
donation? [sentence about why it'd be useful]. Make School, Pipedrive,
Workflowy, and many others support our operations with their products and it
really helps us start more programming clubs with the best tools available.

Let me know what you think, it would make a huge difference for us!

Hi _NAME_!

I am a huge fan of _PRODUCT_! It is one of the only ways I've been able to _DO_THE_THING_!

Now I would love to use _PRODUCT_ for _THING_ at our non-profit, hackEDU. We empower high school students to start and lead student-run programming clubs at their school!

We were wondering if we could get some pro accounts for our team to _THING_ (we currently aren't funded yet so can only manage to afford to purchase food).

It would really make a huge difference for us.

Thanks so much!
Jonathan
