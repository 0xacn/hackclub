### Leading the Hacking Scene

hackEDU hackers are not only at the center of the high school hacking scene but are dominating the collegiate hacking scene as well. At the top two collegiate hackathons in the world, PennApps X and MHacks V, three of the six winning teams were led by high school students. All of these winning high school teams are part of hackEDU.



## Zach Runs HS Hackers

All of our 24 clubs came to hackEDU through inbound interest. Many came from the facebook group HS Hackers, a Facebook group  that representing 3,000 high schoolers from 689 schools across 46 states and 87 countries which was started and is run by my co-founder Zach Latta.
