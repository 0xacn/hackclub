# YC Application

hackEDU's nonprofit YC application for S15.

### Application

**Organization name**

hackEDU

**Organization url, if any**

https://hackedu.us

**If you have an online demo, what's the url?**

N/A

**What will your organization do?**

hackEDU will create a programming club at every high school in America.

We think it's tragic that students who love music can join band, students who
love sports can join an athletic team, but students who code (or might be
interested in learning) have to go home and build things alone. In our clubs we
create communities for the builders (and potential builders) in high school.

[TODO add why/implications]

**Where do you live now, and where would the organization be based after YC?**

SF. SF.

**Email address we should contact you at**

zach@hackedu.us

**Phone number(s)**

**Please provide an email address for each founder in the organization,
including yourself. Founders must have at least 10% equity in the company. We
will send an email to each founder to fill out additional information about
themselves.**

**Please enter the url of a 1 minute unlisted (not private) YouTube video
introducing the founders.**

**Please tell us about an interesting project, preferably outside of class or
work, that two or more of you created together. Include urls if possible.**

We wrote a script that exploits referral codes to order food and delivery for
less than $2 per meal. We've been using it nearly every weekday since November
to cut costs.

**How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any
of the founders not met in person?**

We've known each other since September 2014 (6 months) and met after a mutual
friend introduced Zach, who had just won PennApps, the University of
Pennsylvania's hackathon, to Jonathan, who was a former lead organizer of
PennApps. After neither of us replied to the initial introduction, our friend
send another email making sure we met because he thought we were such perfect
fitting puzzle pieces.

**How far along are you?**

We ran a pilot last semester with 25 schools and reached 1000 students. This
week we onboarded an additional 13 schools, expanding our reach to 1300
students. 32% of our members are female (nearly 2x national average) and 37%
are minorities in tech (7x national average).

At MHacks V and PennApps X, the two largest collegiate hackathons with >1000
attendees flown in from schools including Stanford, MIT, and Harvard, half of
the winning teams were led by high school students, all of whom are part of
their local hackEDU chapter.

Running a programming club has been such an empowering experience for Amy
Sorto, one of our club leaders from New Jersey, she decided to put together a
summer camp to teach 24 girls in middle school how to code. She's already
secured a blank check from Panasonic, laptop donations from Codestarter, and a
venue in Newark.

Some of the things that our club leaders have been saying:

> hackEDU has given me the confidence and resources to lead my club. The
> students in my club have learned many skills and some students have even gone
> to hackathons and won prizes! It is an incredible feeling to know that I am
> making a difference in my school and community.

Elizabeth, NJ

> This is my club's first year and it's been leaps and bounds better than
> expected. Over the course of the year our more than 80 members have made games
> and websites, participated in hackathons, and have volunteered at a local
> middle school for their hour of code. I started my club after talking to the
> hackEDU guys and can say it wouldn't be a reality if they weren't around.

> Leading a hack club in Austin allowed me to start a technology community at my
> high school and make great friends while learning tons.

Luke Wright  
Junior Austin High School  
Austin, TX

> hackEDU has connected me to a network of people who have years of experience
> in the domain that I'm in. They have connected me to people and more over
> ideas on how best to do what I do, to inspire kids to build the next
> generation of technology.

**If you've already started working on it, how long have you been working and
how many lines of code (if applicable) have you written?**

We've been working on hackEDU full-time for 5 months.

**Which of the following best describes your progress?**

* [ ] Nothing Built
* [ ] Sketches
* [ ] Mocks / Renderings
* [ ] Prototype
* [x] Private Beta
* [ ] Public Beta
* [ ] Taking Preorders
* [ ] Launched

**Do you have revenue?**

* [x] No
* [ ] Yes

**If you've applied previously with the same idea, how much progress have you
made since the last time you applied? Anything change?**

TODO: Talk to Beyang about this question

* Figure out what he means by age
  * Explicitly address that last time we heard that age was a factor
    * We're extremely committed to this and plan to work on this for a very
      long time.
    * We've arrived at the point of our interest with this.
  * Perhaps adding a cofounder who's a bit older(y)
  * Show that I'm not going to decide and go to college in a bit.
    * Geoff is saying this because he's probably already seen this already play
      out.

We ran our planned 25 school pilot, reaching 1,000 students, had Jonathan join
as a co-founder, and brought on a full-time volunteer as well as two part-time
volunteers.

**If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator,
"accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program, please tell us about it.**

We have not.

**Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this
area? How do you know this is going to work?**

* Zach wanted a community

During his first year of high school, Zach started a programming club because
he wanted a community of other programmers at his school. By the end of the 2nd
year, the students in his club launched games on the Android Play Store, won
high-profile hackathons, founded a web design firm that landed real clients,
and secured over $30,000 in investment. After meeting other high school students
who had also started programming clubs, he decided to start hackEDU. Being 17,
he is the age of our target demographic and has made himself a leader in the
wider high school programming community. Zach runs HS Hackers, the largest
online community for high school developers (Facebook shared a
[post](https://www.facebookstories.com/stories/112524/building-a-community-for-high-schoolers-who-code)
about it to 2.3m users).

**What's new about what you plan to do?**

* Instead of focusing on teaching a set curriculum at hack clubs, hackEDU
  focuses on building all-inclusive families where members hack on things
  together.
* hackEDU chapters are led by high school students themselves, so starting a
  new club is just as difficult as creating a movie or volunteer club
  (generally a one-page form filed with the school and the commitment of a
  teacher sponsor). This also abstracts us away from a direct service model
  that's limited to scaling linearly (similar to how Airbnb doesn't own any real
  estate, we don't have any chapter leaders on staff).

**Have you incorporated, or formed any legal entity (like an LLC) yet?**

Yes.

**What kind of entity and in what state or country was the entity formed?**

hackEDU is incorporated in the state of Delaware as a non-stock non-profit
corporation.

**If you're already incorporated, when were you? If you've had funding, how
much and from whom?**

HackEDU was incorporated in January of 2014. We've secured a small amount
($10k) of funding from various corporate sponsors.

**Have you obtained your 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status yet?**

We have not, but are in the final stages of closing a fiscal sponsor and are in
the application process.

**Please provide any other relevant information about the structure or
formation of the company.**

N/A

**Are any of the following true?**

* You are the only founder.
* You are a student who may return to school when the next term starts.
* Half or more of your group can't move to the Bay Area.
* One or more founders will keep their current jobs.

* [ ] Yes
* [x] No

**If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them.
One may be something we've been waiting for.**

**Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has
discovered. (The answer need not be related to your project.)**

`fortune | cowsay | lolcat` speaks volumes of truth.

**What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator?**

Engaging with the community on Hacker News and meeting several YC founders.

**How did you hear about Y Combinator?**

Hacker News.

**Please tell us about the time you most successfully hacked some
(non-computer) system to your advantage.**

I hacked my high school education. I exploited a loophole in the California
K-12 education system to get twice the credits in half the time.  College
credits count for twice the amount of high school credits and for core classes,
like language, count for four times the credits. By taking college level
classes full-time, I could have graduated in two years--but I ended up testing
out anyway in one and a half instead.

**Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive thing other
than this startup that you have built or achieved.**

In my freshman year of high school, I joined Run Games as the first employee
and brought our game from an early prototype to launching in the App Store and
getting over one million users. We reached #5 in the top free charts, #1 in
games, #1 in sports, #1 in arcade, and were featured by Apple on the front page
of the App Store.

While organizing PennApps in 2011, I thought it would be compelling for
participants for participants if we could pay for their transportation to our
hackathon. I thought that we would be able to convince MegaBus to be our
"official transportation sponsor" because hackathon goers fit their demographic
of "young persons likely to want travel between large cities cheaply while
using wi-fi". They were interested but hesitant because they didn't want to
associate themselves with all the "hackers" and all the "hacking" that was
happening in the news.

To alleviate their concerns, I innocently sent them the link to the Wikipedia
entry for Hackathon--after I added this: 'Although "hack" is in the root of
hackathon, hackathons have nothing to do with malicious "hacking" done by
hackers, rather the spirit of a hackathon is to collaboratively build programs
and applications.'

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hackathon&diff=442741932&oldid=437209790

By convincing Megabus to sponsor us by "hacking" Wikipedia page, we set the
status quo for hackathons for free transportation.

**Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive thing other
than this startup that you have built or achieved.**

This past summer, I designed and executed a 6-week summer immersion program
focused on catalyzing empowerment for high school students at All Star Code
that took students from 0 to webapps like a real-time multiplayer asteroids
game. After the program, I was proud that students banded together on their own
initiative to throw the Breaking Barriers Hackathon, which they got Google and
Twilio to sponsor and and over 100 of the top high school hackers in NYC to
attend.

**Will you live in the Bay Area June through August 2015, if we fund you?**

Yes.

**Will you commit to working exclusively on this project for the next year?**

Yes.

**Do you have any other commitments between June through August 2015
inclusive?**

No.

**Do you have any commitments in the future and if so what?**

No.
