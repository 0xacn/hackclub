# Labs

This document will contain a brief overview of our labs program and what it'll
entail going into the 2015 fall semester.

## Format

The Labs program will follow this format:

1. Workshops
  - These are based on the workshops from Hack Camp
  - Labs program workshops can be found in the
    (playbook)[https://github.com/hackedu/hackedu/tree/master/playbook/workshops]
2. Case Studies
  - To collect data from each meeting without core hackEDU team members being
    there, each club meeting will have a case study
  - Each case study consists of 2 files:
    1. `planning.md`
    2. `recap.md` ex.
       [click here](../../case_studies/cherry_hill_high_school_east/2015-09-05_first_meeting/recap.md)
