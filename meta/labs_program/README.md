# Labs Program

This document will contain a brief overview of our labs program and what it'll
entail going into the 2015 fall semester.

## Meetings

All meetings related to the labs program should be put into the `meetings`
directory in the current directory and should be named along the lines of
`YY-MM-DD_short_title_here.md`. They should also include who was present during
the meeting.

Here's a brief meeting file template:
