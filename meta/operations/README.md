# Operations

This directory contains files for Hack Club's day-to-day club operations -- i.e. facilitating our clubs. This directory must be regularly updated by staff and should be considered the source of truth for all things operations.

## Calls

We will have one call following the interview. This call will be to onboard club leaders as well as prepare them for their first club meeting. The following files contain process documents on how to run parts of the call.

1. [`calls/00_onboarding.md`](calls/00_onboarding.md) - Onboarding Call
2. [`calls/01_preparing_for_first_meeting.md`](calls/01_preparing_for_first_meeting.md) - Preparing for First Meeting

See [`calls/template.md`](calls/template.md) for a template for making more call process documents.

## Weekly Check-Ins

We use [Howdy](https://howdy.ai/) to do weekly check-ins with one club leader from each active club.

This check-in collects:

- Club attendance during the week
- If there's anything Kyle or Zach can be helpful with?

It runs on Fridays at 1PM Pacific time.

### Setup

To add a club's leader to the weekly Howdy check-ins, just mark the column for Howdy check-ins on Streak as `TRUE` -- the only requirement is that they must have a Slack username set in Streak that starts with `@` (ex. `@zrl`). We've written an integration that automatically takes care of the rest.

To remove a club leader from the weekly check-ins, just mark the Howdy check-ins field as blank. Don't mark it as `FALSE`.
