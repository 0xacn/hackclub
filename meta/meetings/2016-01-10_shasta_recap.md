## Bad

- _Announcements_
  - It wasn't always clear what Jonathan's intention was when speaking
  - Zach didn't have as much emotion as Jonathon, which different students will
    connect differently to. Emotion levels should always feel natural, don't
    fake it.
  - It wasn't announced that it's okay to not have your product done when
    demoing
- _Workshop_
  - Using JS Bin instead of Cloud9 was very difficult
  - JS Bin would not save some students progress and they had to start over
  multiple times.
  - Cloud9 does not seem to work well with projects that require to be "ran"
    using the JS Bin run button.
  - Whether or not people were pairing and how to pair program wasn't clear
    (when we told people they'd be demoing in their pairs, some seemed surprised
    because they'd been working independently)(this miscommunication came
    because of statements Hesby made the prior day)
  - People were struggling to run the examples
  - Hackers need separate Twilio accounts to receive text messages because phone
    numbers are shared across accounts.
  - Might be helpful to "brand" the demos (i.e. give them names and nice landing
    pages)
  - Documentation had small errors that caused large difficulties for students
    since they expect the Documentation to be correct, they don't
    know what to do if it's wrong.
- _Demos_
  - Super unclear how to share from gist JS Bins (`File > Clone` then `File >
    Save Snapshot`)
  - We used email, which was very difficult to follow (because https://tlk.io
    was surprisingly blocked)
  - One person tried to demo the example project (students were told by Hesby to
    remix an example project if they could not come up with their own ideas)
  - Most students did not finish a demo

## Good

- _Announcements_
  - We did a good job getting people's attention
  - Zach's demo was good, timing was potentially good (Matt said that he liked
    the timing)
- _Workshop_
  - Much clearer to follow than old iteration of the workshop, timing of it was
    good
  - People were into the GIF examples and excited by being able to text into the
    examples themselves.
  - Students didn't get stuck on the introductory stages and wanted to move on
    to creating something themselves.
- _Demos_
  - People felt comfortable demoing (high confidence, nobody asked if they have
    to demo)
  - Students expressed joy and some took time to say that they learned some
    really cool things.
