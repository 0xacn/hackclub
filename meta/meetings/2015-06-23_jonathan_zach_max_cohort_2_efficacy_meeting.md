Attendance: Jonathan, Zach, Max

Objective
- create a system to create tasks for cohort 2

Water-fall was not working well from last week
- Just in time model for curriculum
- Curriculum can be much more distributed
- Not all members are able to contribute as much as they would like
  - Perhaps @andreadeng hasn't had the opportunity to participate as much as she
    would like?
    - Specifically, our workflow is not transparent enough for all members of
      the organization
    - @MaxWofford will have a meeting for GitHub onboarding (might be useful to
      take notes on this for future onboarding)
  - @MaxWofford is potentially underutilized

Actionable outcomes:
- Schedule meeting with @andreadeng for GitHub onboarding (@MaxWofford)
- 1-on-1 between @jonleung and @zachlatta about scheduling Friday meeting
- 1-on-1 between @MaxWofford and @zachlatta about follow up from meeting
