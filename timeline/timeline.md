West Coast Research – Figure out what to test next week (test biggest problems faced)
Build Case Studies (basically get club organizers to each write club in a box), perhaps fill out preliminary sections + Meetups + Tooling + Simulate Clubs in Once A Week Workshops (Monday workshop series, Tuesday workshop series), and have other club organizers test it out as well (like amy), Summer School . Full Year Students? Have club leaders and clubs in the bay area to run 2 week or weekly ones of these, have students pay.

## High Level Timeline

### 1. Spring 2015 | April 17th - May 30th | 6 weeks

```
Primary Objective: Learn and do validated learning as much as we can while schools is still in session
Theme: Get out of the building
```

- research club leader & member motivations and problems from existing clubs
- form hypotheses and test assumptions on a weekly basis using [bullets, not cannon balls](http://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/great-by-choice/)

### 2. Summer 2016 | June 1 - August 16th | 12 weeks

```
Primary Objective: Build and test the club in a box so that we know that it's battle ready in the fall.
Theme: Get of of the building and simulate club situations
```

- iteratively build and test club-in-a-box by running summer club sessions

### 3. Fall 2016 | August 16th - December 31st | 20 weeks
- deploy interate on Club in a box (there will be natural staggaring here)


## Detailed Timeline

### Spanning Projects

- Get People and Plan for Summer Program
	- [ ] Design how to design the plan
- Get People and Plan for Fall Program
- 	- [ ] Design how to design the plan

### Spring 2015, April 17th - May 30th — 6 weeks

```
s1 == week 1 of spring
s2 == week 2 of spring
```

#### s1 - s6
- Design and run experiments: [bullets, not cannon balls](http://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/great-by-choice/)
	- [ ] What is the objective of these experiments? 

- Design the best club meetings
	- [ ] What is the objective of these  meetings?

- Get in touch with bay area schools:
	- Learn what works and what doesn't (see [information gathering](https://github.com/hackedu/club-in-a-box/issues/9))
	- Develop relationships with them to onboard them into hackEDU
	
- Plan Summer Program
	- [ ] Create a plan for how to plan the program

#### s1
- [Data Collection Project](https://github.com/hackedu/club-in-a-box/issues/9)
 
#### s1 - s3
- west coast tour, @jonleung, @MaxWofford, @ZachLatta
- [ ] plan east coast tour
- potential time strategy
	- during the day when there are no club meetings
		- gather data
	- late afternoons, when there are club meetings
		- Tu, Th: 	  run our own club meetings
		- Mo, We, Fr: visit other club meetings

#### s4 - s6
- east coast tour, @jonleung, @ZachLatta
- west coast tour, @MaxWofford

#### Things To Test

##### Direct
- How do you get learners X enough to build their won projects at home?
	- excited
	- know how to self-learn
	- confident
- What's the most effective way to build communities that build things together?
- How do you get people tapped into the larger hacker community?

###### Meta
- How do you get people to contribute to building this community?
- How do you package it in a way that makes it very easy to learn?

```
Potential questions to ask club organizers
(1a) why would you say that you started a programming club at your school

(1b) why do you think other people may want to start a club at their school?

(2) What do are / have been your top 3 biggest blocking factors to starting and running a club?

(3a) How did current members hear about your club?

(3b) What do you think are the reasons why people joined your club?

```


## Summer 2016 | June 1 - August 16th | 12 weeks

```
Primary Objective: Build and Test club in a box for the fall so that we know that it's ready to go.
```


### Potential Strategies
- Simulate clubs in the summer and run Staggered Iterations that build and then test Club in a Box (in separate instances)
	- Potential Locations
		- Summer School
		- 3rd Party Location
	- Potential Students
		- Summer School Students
		- Students in summer who have free time
		- Students outside of our target high school demographic
	- Potential Time Frames Timeframe (19 chunks in fall), Summer == 12 weeks
		- Daily, Over 3.8 weeks
		- 3x Per Week, 6.3 weeks 
		- 2x Per Week 10 Weeks
	-  Timeframe (22 in spring)
- Perhaps organizing regional meetups?
- Package it in a way that allows Zach to follow the club in a box (I have to do it 3 times first, then I package it for Zach who does it once, and then I package it for Max to do another run through again)
- We can service different locations if we stagger meetings
- Get the knoweldge of exisiting clubs, perhaps have them help by writing case studies or we can just ask them in real time?
- Perhaps getting club organizers to run their own versions of summer programs like amy.



## Fall 2016 | August 16th - December 31st | 20 weeks
1. Deploy And Iterate on Club in a box (there will be natural staggaring here)


## TEMP: Data Collection That Need To Be Moved

What are some of the problems you're facing the most?

"Finding a club sponsor is huge, and IMO the biggest deal: our club sponsor is amazing, learned coding over the summer just for the club, one of the most likeable and intelligent teachers in the school. Having good projects (our valentines day and march madness and minigame projects) and club events (codeday, hour of code) is big. Computers with all the software a club needs is unlikely (our tech department hasn't installed a *single* thing we've requested since the start of the year. Not even python! Python is like a one-click install) but is really nice. Money isn't really an issue since so much of coding is free, but subscriptions to online tutorials can take a lot of money."
