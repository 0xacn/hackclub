# PagerDuty Workflow

PagerDuty is Hack Club's on-call system and issue escalation policy. It works by scheduling turns for engineers to be responsible for resolving any problem that occurs in production.

## Create An Account

The first step is to get an invite to PagerDuty. Get in touch with a staff member that already has an account and ask them to send an invite.

## On-Call

When on-call, it is your responsibility to resolve every issue that occurs in PagerDuty. Resolving an issue doesn't only mean closing it -- you can also mark it as unimportant, or bring in someone with more domain-specific knowledge to work on the fix. "Resolving" an issue only means the issue is marked as "ignore" or "resolved" in Sentry with a comment explaining why the issue was marked that way.
