## Notes

* When you don't know the value of something, put a variable.
* Whenever you see the word current, it means that it's a variable.
* **Every time you translate a line of English to a line of code, run it.**
* Don't read the English, have the students read it.
* Don't tell students how to do something, have them read the documentation
  to figure it out.
* Good programmers are lazy.
* If students get stuck on moving the tortoise on the X axis, ask "what do you
  need to tell the tortoise to do this?" Remind them of getters and setters.
