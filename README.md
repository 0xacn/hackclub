## About

Hack Clubs are after-school communities at high schools where people build
things together. This repo contains the tools for starting and leading great
clubs.

## Contributing

Hack Club is built by a community of volunteers and a small team of full-time
staff. Submit a contribution and help grow coding communities in more high
schools. Start by checking out [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

1. Check out our
   [public issues board](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/issues). If your
   issue isn't on the board,
   [open an issue](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/issues/new).
2. Pick an issue that nobody has claimed and start working on it. First time
   contributors should look for the
   [first-timers-only](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/labels/first-timers-only)
   label on issues.
3. Fork the project
   ([Need help forking a project?](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)).
   You'll do all of your work on your forked copy.
4. Create a branch specific to the issue or feature you are working on. Push
   your work on that branch
   ([Need help with branching?](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches)).
5. Name the branch something like `fixes-xxx-issue` or `add-xx-feature` where
   `xxx` is a short description of the changes or feature you are adding.
6. Your changes should follow Hack Club's
   [styleguides](https://github.com/hackclub/meta/blob/master/styleguides/markdown.md).
7. Once your code is ready, submit a pull request from your branch to Hack
   Club's `master` branch. We'll do a quick review and give you feedback.
