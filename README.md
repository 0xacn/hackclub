### Mission

* hackEDU empower 1st and 2nd year high school students to build things they
  care about with code. We do this by creating, connecting, and growing closely
  knit student-run coding communities at high schools.


### Key Mey Metric

* number of programming projects built outside of class.

### Sorted List Of Assumptions, Biggest and Most Important Assumption At Top

* By first identifying which clubs have the most projects produced and then
  spreading their knowledge and expertise to other club organizers and then to
  members, we can increase the number of projects built by those clubs.
* 1st and 2nd year high school students will more readily join clubs than 3rd
  and 4th years. Measurability: when spending the same amount effort, more 1st
  and 2nd years join than 3rd or 4th years.
* Having 1st and 2nd year high school organizers join clubs will allow them to
  take on leadership positions later in the club.
