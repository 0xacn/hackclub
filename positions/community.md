# Community

We see Hack Club being valuable in two ways:

- Providing a very easy way to start a coding club
- Having an amazing, diverse community

Having an easy way to start a coding club means very little without a community
to back it.

We are nowhere near creating a community for Hack Club. Now's the time to change
that.

Here are some of our current problems, among many others:

- We have a Facebook group that is rarely used
- Club leaders barely know each other and barely know of each other's existence
- Many of them know very little about the organization
