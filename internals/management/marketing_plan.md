# Marketing Strat

Two goals:

1. **Short-term:** Make Hack Club synonymous with coding clubs **(coding clubs = Hack Club)**
2. **Long-term:** Make Hack Club synonymous with high schoolers coding out of class **(high schooler coding out of class = Hack Club)**

## Coding Clubs = Hack Club

Build seeds to create new clubs to trigger grassroots strategy in new areas.

Immediate seeds to build:

1. Own SEO
2. Dominate online discussion
3. Storytelling of good clubs

If there are clear one-off stunts to do, do them. Eyeballs = conversions.

## High Schooler Coding Out Of Class = Hack Club

Focus on _coding clubs = Hack Club_, approach this later.
