As illustrated by the amazing GIF above, this directory is for anything related to managing Hack Club's work.

**Long-term goal:**

By the end of 2019, how can Hack Club become a quickly-growing, yet efficient and financially secure organization that has a significant beachhead across US public schools with many high quality chapters that are modeling the behaviors we want to see in education everywhere?

---

**Short-term goal for 2017 summer:**

1. Improve experience for leaders starting and running clubs
2. Get more people interested in starting clubs
3. Put ourselves in a position to move super fast
4. Start measuring quality
5. Secure enough funding to carry us through the end of 2017

**Managing work:**

Work is broken down into work-specific, sprint-like **projects**. Each project has a corresponding [organization-wide GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/hackclub/projects) and an associated deadline.

Projects should exist for no longer than 30 days and cannot contain subprojects. Long-term projects should be broken down into more managable chunks.

[The main GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/hackclub/projects/2) tracks the progress of projects.
