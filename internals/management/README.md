# Management

As illustrated by the amazing GIF above, this directory is for anything related to managing Hack Club's work.

---

**Goals:**

- [Long-term (5 years)](long_term.md)
- [Short-term (summer)](short_term.md)

**Managing work:**

Work is broken down into work-specific, sprint-like _projects_. Each project has a corresponding [organization-wide GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/hackclub/projects) and an associated deadline.

Projects should ideally exist for no longer than 30 days and cannot contain subprojects. Once a project's deadline is passed, it should be closed (not deleted). Long-term projects should be broken down into more managable chunks.

[The main GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/hackclub/projects/2) tracks the progress of projects.
