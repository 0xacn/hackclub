**Managing work:**

Work is broken down into work-specific, sprint-like _projects_. Each project has a corresponding [organization-wide GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/hackclub/projects) and an associated deadline.

Projects should ideally exist for no longer than 30 days and cannot contain subprojects. Long-term projects should be broken down into more managable chunks.

[The main GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/hackclub/projects/2) tracks the progress of projects.
