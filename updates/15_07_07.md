## Next Steps

Our summer program is structured to map one-to-one to our clubs during the
school year and we're using it to build our "club playbook" for next semester.
We're currently hard at work preparing for our third session and have begun
working on our rollout plan for next semester.

We have two primary objectives going into the next semester:

1. Rolling out and iterating on our "club playbook"
2. Onboarding ~25 additional schools

I'll keep you in the loop as we progress. We have a long ways to go, but I know
we can do this together.

Best regards,  
Zach
