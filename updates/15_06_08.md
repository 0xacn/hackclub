### Hack Camp

We're running a two-week summer program to build the first iteration of our
"club in a box"---our plug-and-play "playbook" for starting high school coding
clubs. Hack Camp brings participants from little or no coding experience to
creating games and publishing websites (with the broader goal of inspiring the
hacker mindset). We were originally targetting the program at local high school
students, but within two weeks of launching the program we received applications
from 13 states and 5 countries.

We're still in the early stages of 

> I liked the time given to us for self-discovery(both personally and

> to explore what he/she wants, and I think that should be more prevalent in
> other institutions . . . [I]nstruction at this camp isn't merely regarding
> coding; it includes about life in general, which is a really important and
> nice touch since it relates to coding.
