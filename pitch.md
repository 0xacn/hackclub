# Pitch

## Short

When I was 7 I loved Club Penguin so much I learned to program and built a
website about it. Now I'm running hackEDU, a nonprofit organization that
ignites that same passion by teaching students to code. We help students start
and lead programming clubs at their high schools by providing training,
mentors, and any resources needed to make their club a success.
