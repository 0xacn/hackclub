Hi {lab_director_name}!

This past year has been exciting, and it was amazing working together with you!
I know that we've certainly learned a lot.

In the next two months, Hack Club is focusing on growth. It's time to onboard
the 50+ clubs on our waitlist! Because of this, we're focusing on getting the
early workshops right (i.e. workshop 1 and 2 and such). This means that we might
not have curriculum that's targeted for clubs like yours which are already well
past workshops 1 and 2. We are comfortable with doing this because we know
you'll be able to figure it out with each other!

For these new clubs, we're putting together a [Hack Club Guide]
(https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/blob/master/clubs/README.md).
We'd love your feedback on this guide here:
[here](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/commit/f418eea0e904938e0765f73d58216710d936a1f7).

You are Hack Club's inaugural class! It is now time for you to help the next
generation of club leaders. Make them feel welcome---make the Slack feel like
it's their home. They'll be reaching out for questions---go out of your way to
help them out!

Let's make 2016 amazing!
Jonathan, Zach
