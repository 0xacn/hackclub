Subject: Hack Club Semester 2 Update

Hi everyone!

We've learned and failed a tremendous amount this past semester. All of you
have been incredibly supportive and both of us feel so privileged to have the
opportunity to work with each and every one of you.

In the next two months, Hack Club is focusing on growth. Our goal is to start
50 clubs and increase our weekly attendance by 750 students by the end of
February. As a result of this, we're focusing on rewriting our early workshops
and standardizing the beginning of clubs ([click here][club_guide] for an
example of what we're working on). This means that we won't be building
curriculum for clubs like yours at the pace we did last semester and we may
not have new workshops in time for all of your meetings while we're still
early into this semester.

Your work this past semester has led us to where we are today and we'll only
be able to continue the movement with your continued involvement. As we
onboard new clubs, the best way for you to contribute is to welcome and
support new club leaders. Make the Slack feel like it's their home. We're
looking to pair existing clubs with new clubs to start the mentorship early.
If you are interested in being a mentor to new clubs, please reply directly to
this email to let us know.

Let's make 2016 amazing!  
Jonathan & Zach
