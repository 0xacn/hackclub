# Setup

## Format

The Labs program will follow this format:

1. Workshops
  - These are based on the workshops from Hack Camp
  - Labs program workshops can be found in the
    [playbook](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/tree/master/playbook/workshops)
2. Case Studies
  - To collect data from each meeting without core Hack Club team members being
    there, each club meeting will have a case study
  - Each case study consists of 2 files:
    1. `planning.md`
    2. `recap.md` ex.
