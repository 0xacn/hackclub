# Labs

We're working with 12 clubs to build the first version of our club playbook (in
the [hackclub](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub) repository!) in the fall
2015 semester. Labs is what we're calling the 12 clubs we've selected.

Labs clubs are led by the vehement Lab Directors. They're the brave souls that
are venturing forth to make a difference in their communities through Hack
Clubs.

If you'd like to see our (incomplete) document for setting up Labs, check out
[`SETUP.md`](SETUP.md).
