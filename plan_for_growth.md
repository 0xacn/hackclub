### Recognition for Our Club Members

hackEDU hackers are not only at the center of the high school hacking scene but
are dominating the collegiate hacking scene as well. At the top two collegiate
hackathons in the world, PennApps X and MHacks V, three of the six winning teams
were led by high school students. All of these winning high school teams are
part of hackEDU.

- PennApps X (1st place): Avi Romanoff, 18, won 1st place by building a web IDE
  for developing iOS apps in the browser
- PennApps X (2nd place): Rohith Varanasi, 17, won 2nd place by controlling a
  Boosted Board with a Myo.
- PennApps XI (best health hack): Krish Dholakiya, 16, won best health hack by
  streamlining doctor-patient interaction with iOS and the Apple Watch.
- MHacks V (2nd place): Raphael Kats, 17, won 2nd place out of 1300 attendees by
  transmitting internet over FM radio.
- Hacking Generation Y (1st place): Luke Wright, 17, won 1st by creating an app
  that took unsuspecting Tinder users through old school text adventure games.
- Hacking Generation Y (3rd place): Raphael Kats, 17, and our newest club
  leader, Amy Sorto, 17, won 3rd place by creating a virtual reality world with
  the Oculus navigated with a wheel chair.

## Plan for Growth

### Spring 2014 (January - June)

We are creating the "Club Playbook", a guide on how to create and run the best
progrmaming clubs. This will include:

- Curriuculum for learning technical content
- Excercises for team building
- Providing local mentors for the club
- Physical hardware such as Makey Makeys

Complimented with the Playbook, we will be working with organizers week to week
over calls.

#### Onboard 50 More Schools into the HackEDU Network

All of our 24 clubs came to hackEDU through inbound interest. Many came from the
facebook group HS Hackers, representing 6,000+ high schoolers from 689 schools
across 46 states and 87 countries which was started and is run by one of our
founders, Zach latta.

Moreover, from a survey that we did at the premier Hack Generation Y hackathon,
we learned that there are over 60 clubs just in the bay area alone that are not
part of our network yet that expressed interest. #insert other statistics here.

##### Create And Iterate on The Club Playbook

- Take what we've learned from our Fall 2014 pilot
- Have all of our club

### Summer 2015 (June - August)

In the Summer of 2015, we are taking our iterated upon version of club in a box
and automating it.

# Fall 2015 (September - October)

For September's Launch, we want 100 additional schools.

- $500 per school, $20 per kid
- We are helping lower income schools purchase
- computers
- hardware
- At this rate, 2 clubs a week
