# High Schools

Creates a CSV with a list of high schools to approach along with important
information.

Currently really hacky and needs the following improvements made:

* Take command-line arguments for various options.
* Support an arbitrarily large number of groups to search through.
* Support group member paging (Facebook starts paging at 5000 members).
* Filter for uniques.
* Logic separation into separate methods.

## Requirements

Must have the following environment variables set:

* `FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Facebook access token
