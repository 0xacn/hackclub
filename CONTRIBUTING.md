## Code of Conduct

Hack Club's community includes people from many different backgrounds. Hack Club
is committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.

If you join in or contribute to the Hack Club ecosystem, you are encouraged to
follow our [Code of Conduct](CONDUCT.md) while doing so.

## Find Something To Change

Usually, as a contributor you know what you want to work on. Perhaps something
along the lines of workshops, standards or implementing guidelines. However, if
you do not know where to begin you can always search through the open
[GitHub issues][issues] to find something suitable. If you are a beginner (or
have never contributed to an Open Source repository before) you may be
interested in checking out issues with the
[`first-timers-only` tag][first_timers].

## Talk About It On Slack

If you are going to make a big change, discuss it on our Slack in the
[`#curriculum` channel][curriculum_channel] to give us a heads up
([Don't have a Slack account?][slack]). To get an even more speedy response,
mention `@jonl` and `@harrison`.

## Create An Issue

If you don't know how to fix something yourself, you can
[create an issue][create_issue]. Remember to be as specific as possible so it is
very easy for someone else claim and implement.

## Make A Change

1. All contributions should be made through your own fork
   ([Need help forking a repository?][fork]). Once you have your own fork set up
   you can begin making your changes on it.
2. Check out a branch from your fork that describes the change being made. Make
   sure you only include commits in this branch that are related to the branch's
   feature.
3. After you have made your changes and pushed them onto your GitHub fork, you
   can create a Pull Request
   ([Want help submitting a Pull Request?][pull_request]). If the Pull Request
   resolves an issue, be sure to have the issue number in the description.

## Wait For Review

Before we can merge your code into the repository it has to be reviewed by one
of the core contributors. It will be assessed on how well it follows the
[contribution guidelines](GUIDELINES.md) and if it is intended to solve an
issue, how well it does so.

If all goes well, your code should be merged in very quickly... If not, then a
merge is usually just a quick fix away!

## Celebrate!
