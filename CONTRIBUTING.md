# Contribution Guidelines

## General Guidelines

- Conversations in pull requests and issues must align with the [Hack Club code of conduct](https://hackclub.com/conduct/).
- Please be patient and kind towards maintainers as a lot of them are volunteers.
- Make sure the pull request or issue doesn't already exist before making it.

## Contributing a Workshop

Hey there! Super excited to see that you want to contribute to a workshop. Before we get started make sure you have the following:

- A GitHub account - [Sign Up](https://github.com/join)
- Basic markdown knowledge - [Learn Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)

That's it! Just make sure that your workshop idea [isn't already being worked on](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) and [doesn't already exist](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/tree/main/workshops). Let's get started!

### üç¥ Fork this Repository

If you are familiar with git you know that you can make pull requests from branches. Because you don't have write access to this repository you need to [make a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and then make a PR from that fork.

### ‚ú® Create README.md

You will be writing your workshop in a README.md file located in a folder within the workshops folder. So if your workshop is called `Building a Rocket with CSS` a good folder name would be `css-rocket`. This means that you would create a README file in `workshops/css-rocket/README.md`. You can create this file within the GitHub editor or with your editor once cloned.

### üõ† Writing the Workshop

Please read our [workshop guidelines](https://workshops.hackclub.com/workshop-bounty/) to understand what a workshop looks like.

### üöÄ Submitting the PR

Now all you have to do is [submit the PR from the fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)!

### üëÄ Next Steps

Now someone will review your workshop! Keep in mind this might take some time so please be patient. Thank you for submitting your workshop!
