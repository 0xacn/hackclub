# Contributing to hackEDU

Contributions to hackEDU are very welcome, and strongly encouraged (even to this
document)!

## Doing it

We use a modified version of
[GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) at hackEDU. The only
difference is instead of deploying from a reviewed pull request, we merge first
and deploy straight from master.

Part of the GitHub Flow is submitting pull requests. See
https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ for a good overview of
what pull requests are and how to use them. Internally, we use the _shared
repository model_ for collaborative development, though we encourage external
contributors to contribute through the _fork & pull model_.

When contributing, please pay attention to the commit format of other commits in
the repository.

### Style Guides

If a style guide exists for the language you're contributing in, please do the
maintainers of the repository a favor and follow it. If you notice anything that
deviates from our style guide, don't hesitate to submit a pull request to fix
it. It's very appreciated!
