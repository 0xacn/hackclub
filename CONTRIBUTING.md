# How To Contribute

This is a guide explaining the contribution workflow we use at Hack Club!

- [Find something you want to change](#find-something-to-change)
- [If it is big, talk about it on Slack](#talk-about-it-on-slack)
- [Create an issue if you want to proceed](#create-an-issue)
- [Make a PR](#make-a-pr)
- [Wait for review](#wait-for-review)

## Find Something To Change

Usually, as a contributor you know what you want to work on. Perhaps something
along the lines of workshops, standards or implementing guidelines. However, if
you do not know where to begin [you can always search through the open GitHub
issues](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/issues) to find something suitable.
If you are a complete beginner (or have never contributed to an Open Source
repository before) you may be interested in [checking out issues with the
`first-timers-only` tag](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afirst-timers-only).

## Talk About It On Slack

Wasting time is not fun! If you are going to make a big change to a workshop
(or even adding a new one) it is recommended that you join our Slack and talk
about it on the `#curriculum` channel. To get an even more speedy response,
mention `@jonl` and `@harrison`.

## Create An Issue

If you don't feel like creating the fix yourself, you should create an issue on
the repository so that someone else can claim it. Remember to be as specific as
possible so it is very easy to understand and implement.

## Make A PR

After you have made your changes and pushed them onto your GitHub
hackclub/hackclub fork, you should create a Pull Request. It is best practice
to have different Pull Requests for groups of commits which do different
things. For example, you could be working on both a workshop and writing
guidelines, but because those are different things they belong in different
Pull Requests. If the Pull Request is to resolve an issue, be sure to note the
issue number at some point in the description.

## Wait For Review

Before we can get your code into the main repository you it has to be reviewed
by one the core contributors. While it is being assessed, it will be judged on
how well it follows the [contribution guidelines](GUIDELINES.md), and if based
off of an issue how well it satisfies it.

If all goes well, your code should be merged in very quickly... If not, then a
merge is usually just a quick fix away!
