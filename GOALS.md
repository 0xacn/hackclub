This document outlines our goals in the short term, medium term, and long term
as an organization.

# Progress Overview

## 2014 - 2015 School Year

- Concluded with 40 clubs in 11 states, reaching 1300 hackers
  - 32% female (nearly 2x AP CS average)
  - 37% black/Hispanic (7x industry average)

Potentially our biggest failure this school year was that we didn't have a
concrete model for starting and running a Hack Club. We were working with many
hackers who were starting clubs, but in many situations we weren't sure what was
best for them to do. We eventually stopped doing regular checkins with many of
our clubs because we couldn't provide much value and we eventually lost touch
with many clubs. When we were helpful, it was handled on a case-by-case basis
and not reproducible.

## 2015 Summer

Before trying to bring more clubs into our network, we decided that it was
important to take a step back and create a solid model for our clubs to use as a
foundation. We took this summer to run
[Hack Camp](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp) as our first step in doing
that. We thought of Hack Camp as a compressed club during the school year with
the following objective:

> The objective of Hack Camp is build an set of materials that allows any
> hackEDU team member to reproduce an experience that that brings people from no
> coding knowledge to having the ability, motivation, and confidence to create
> coding projects and continue learning new coding concepts with others, without
> the explicit urging or leading of a teacher.

Hack Camp overview:

- We found a curriculum model for Hack Camp that we're very confident in and
  predict will translate well to a club context.
- We created a
  [Hack Camp playbook](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/tree/master/cohort_4/playbook)
  that previous hackers in Hack Camp and
  [@gemmabusoni](https://github.com/gemmabusoni) were able to run a cohort from.
- Ran four cohorts ranging in size from 4 to 11 hackers.
- Got some

# 2015 - 2016 School Year

For the upcoming 2015 - 2016 school year, we have two objectives:

1. Convert the Hack Camp playbook to a playbook for starting Hack Clubs and get
   it to the point where we're confident enough in it to start rolling it out at
   new clubs
2. Scale

## Playbook

Going into the first semester of the 2015 - 2016 school year, our primary
objective is to create the initial version of a club playbook.

This playbook should include:

- How to get a club up and running
- Suggested format and facilitation guidelines for running club meetings
- A series of workshops to be run in clubs

We're running what we're calling
[Labs](https://github.com/hackedu/hackedu/tree/master/meta/labs) to build a
diverse team of clubs to iterate on the club playbook with. We'll be focusing on
this set of clubs as our testing ground for nearly everything going into this
next semester.

## Scale

After we have an initial version of the club playbook that we're confident in,
our primary objective will be to implement it at new clubs.
