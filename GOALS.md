This document outlines our goals in the short term, medium term, and long term
as an organization.

# Progress Overview

## 2014 to 2015 School Year

- Concluded with 40 clubs in 11 states, reaching 1300 hackers
  - 32% female (nearly 2x AP CS average)
  - 37% black/Hispanic (7x industry average)

Potentially our biggest failure this school year was that we didn't have a
concrete model for starting and running a Hack Club. We were working with many
hackers who were starting clubs, but in many situations we weren't sure what was
best for them to do. We eventually stopped doing regular checkins with many of
our clubs because we couldn't provide much value and we eventually lost touch
with many clubs. When we were helpful, it was handled on a case-by-case basis
and not reproducible.

## 2015 Summer

Before trying to bring more clubs into our network, we decided that it was
important to take a step back and create a solid model for our clubs to use as a
foundation. We took this summer to run
[Hack Camp](https://github.com/hackclub/hack-camp) as our first step in doing
that. We thought of Hack Camp as a compressed club during the school year with
the following objective:

> The objective of Hack Camp is build an set of materials that allows any Hack
> Club team member to reproduce an experience that that brings people from no
> coding knowledge to having the ability, motivation, and confidence to create
> coding projects and continue learning new coding concepts with others, without
> the explicit urging or leading of a teacher.

Hack Camp overview:

- We found a curriculum model for Hack Camp that we're very confident in and
  predict will translate well to a club context.
- We created a
  [Hack Camp playbook](https://github.com/hackclub/hack-camp/tree/master/cohort_4/playbook)
  that previous hackers in Hack Camp and
  [@gemmabusoni](https://github.com/gemmabusoni) were able to run a cohort from.
- Ran four cohorts ranging in size from 4 to 11 hackers.
- Got some

# 2015 to 2016 School Year

For the upcoming 2015 - 2016 school year, we have two objectives:

1. Convert the Hack Camp playbook to a playbook for starting Hack Clubs and get
   it to the point where we're confident enough in it to start rolling it out at
   new clubs
2. Scale

## First Semester

**Goal: Build v1 of club playbook so we can onboard a new club**

_What this means:_

- The playbook includes:
  - [ ] How to start a club
  - [ ] How to onboard into Hack Club
  - [ ] Workshops for 8 meetings
  - [ ] Suggested meeting format for 12 meetings
  - [ ] Facilitation guidelines for first 12 meetings
- [ ] We have a way that works to get meeting-to-meeting metrics (and eventually
  semester metrics)
- [ ] The playbook has a smooth UX and is accessible

### Weeks

#### November 16th

##### Community

- 1-1 interactions between labs leaders
- Every labs leader in Slack
- Every labs leader posts update in Slack
- Slackin integration so club members can sign up for the slack
- Survey leaders and ask how connected they feel to other labs leader in their
  cohort
- Pair labs leaders with the other leaders they feel least connected to

##### Curriculum

- mvp1 of the Hack Club portal shipped (features of this need to be defined in
  the future)
- 2 additional workshops shipped

##### Technical

- Shipped projects are tracked
- Case studies are submitted by 10 of 12 labs clubs each week

##### Meta

Reduce chaos

- Everyone is working from a fork
- Repos are licensed
- It's clear where things are in our repos
- All applicants are responded to
- Applicant review process is clearly defined and handed off to someone else on
  the team
- Organization is renamed to Hack Club (at least publicly)
- Board is cleaned up and has flow

#### November 30th

##### Community

- Club members join slack (at least 3 labs leaders get their entire clubs to
  join)
- Every labs leader active for the week in Slack
- Every Hack Club club leader added to Slack (post in facebook group)
- > 10 active mentors in Slack
- #web #ios #android #hardware channels

##### Curriculum

- mvp2 of the Hack Club portal shipped (features of this need to be defined in
  the future)
- 1 additional workshops shipped

##### Technical

- Club leaders and members can access workshops from packrat
- Club leaders can submit case_studies through packrat
- Case studies are submitted by all clubs each week

##### Meta

Culture of experimentation.

- Both Jonathan and Dave have submitted pull requests to a technical project
- We have weekly metrics for attendance in Labs clubs, the Facebook group, and
  the Slack community that can be fetched with a single Hubot command.
- We have a dashboard created to show our weekly metrics (and metrics for
  individual clubs)
- We have clear facilitation guidelines (in some form)

#### December 14th

##### Community

- Club members hacking together
- Fontebot/Steward welcomes everyone who joins Slack (asks what they are
  building this semester)
- Fontebot/Steward posts after every meeting in #general
- If club members are in our slack we can ping them after our meetings

##### Curriculum

- mvp3 of the Hack Club portal shipped (features of this need to be defined in
  the future)
- 1 additional workshop shipped

##### Technical

- Centralized website repo including Packrat (merge packrat and website)

##### Meta

Public presence and club onboarding

- We're featuring more stories from our hackers and have increased our social
  media presence.
- For someone who's getting ready to start a club, the playbook somewhat clearly
  outlines what the steps are
  - It's clear what the recommended format is for clubs

#### December 28th

##### Community

- Slack stays alive over break
- Think of fun community activity to have over break that keeps people engaged:
  maybe winter of hack

##### Curriculum

- Ship polished version of the Hack Club portal

##### Technical

##### Meta

Semester 2

- We've chosen the clubs we want to work with next semester and have started
  talking next steps with them (perhaps do these in cohorts. 4 each week or
  something)
- It's clear how to get onboard those clubs
  - Process to add them to the community
  - What they should do in their meetings
  - What they need to do to remain a Hack Club club
- The expectations for our clubs are clear

## Second Semester

After we have an initial version of the club playbook that we're confident in,
our primary objective will be to implement it at new clubs.
