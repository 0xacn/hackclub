Despite being quite short, this document outlines our major objectives over the
next 6 months (starting in December 2016).

# Remainder of December 2016

- [ ] Write out onboarding process for new clubs in January. Basically an
  "onboarding club playbook". It should include:
    - Application review process
    - Accountability mechanism
        - Attendance
        - Weekly calls
    - How do we add them to the community?
- [ ] First two meetings are planned out and tested in real life
    - We should be able to concretely answer the question "how do I run the
      first two meetings" from club leaders

# January - April

- #1 focus :: weekly club member growth
    - It's important that we have a mechanism set up to measure this (maybe
      weekly calls with every club?)
- Goal: start 50 clubs by the end of February
