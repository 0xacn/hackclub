# First Meeting

We had our first meeting today under the new reformed club banner. It was
really awesome to see some new faces who were interested in coding at our
school. Our year range currently only consists of the year below me, however I
am going to bring in some of the younger students which I have previously
connected with. Unfortunately we had to cut the meeting short due to starting
late.

## What we did

For this first meeting we set up GitHub accounts and spoke about a project
which we all wanted to make. By the looks of it, the majority of our members
are interested in design and games. I'm going to suggest working through the
portfolio workshop first, and then moving into the game stream (`dodge->maze`).

We also started up a Facebook chat which we are going to use for communication.
This worked reasonably well for the old club and I didn't want to potentially
muffle the conversation by initially pushing everyone to use Slack. I'll move
over at a later date.

## Diversity

One of the thing I noticed was the under represtentation of literally every
possible minority. I'm going to start by getting a few of girls who were 'just
observing' interested, it is probably better to do this personally than get one
of my coleads to act as a middleman.

## Conclusion

I really want to look at getting our group to do the [Ludum
Dare](http://ludumdare.com) game development jam again. As the last group which
I worked through that with had really positive thoughts about it (and had a
boat load of fun!). We are definitely making process and everyone seems very
excited.
