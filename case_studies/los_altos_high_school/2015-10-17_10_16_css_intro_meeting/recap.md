## Questions

### What did do during the event and how did it differ from the plan?

We introduced CSS with a 3 minute presentation, and gave portfolio workshop to
our hackers.  It differed from our original plan of making 2 workshops, one for
beginners and one for advanced, but we had issues with time.

We also gave out the feedback form but there were issues with getting it to work
properly on time.

### What went well?

Getting people to review HTML as well as learn new things about CSS!

### What didn't go well?

Feedback form usage, it didn't work on time. We also didn't send out a recap
email Friday night, which in turn didn't allow us to send out a feedback form.

### What tips do you have for other organizers?

Be aware of time - there are many issues with getting curricula done on time,
and time commitment is seriously a huge blocking factor that all high schoolers
have.
