# Recap

## Summary

- We had around 20 people show up
- Went over Slack, GitHub accounts that we're using for the club
- Went over HTML concepts and lectured on them
- Gave some time to go through the workshop we made

### Events

- Silicon Valley Code Camp volunteer opportunity

## Questions

### What did you do during the event and how did it differ from the plan?

We went through HTML and had a lecture on it, and allowed students to go through
a workshop that we made.  However, there wasn't very much time allotted to
allowing club members to explore HTML because we started the meeting relatively
late and had to go over other club procedural things.

### What went well?

We had quite a few hackers show up! We don't usually see too many people
interested in programming at our school, so we were pretty happy with the
number of people that showed up.

### What didn't go well?

Not having enough time to let people look at HTML.  A huge part of coding is
learning by doing, and only giving them 10-15 minutes to actually play around
with HTML was definitely not enough for them to process too much information.

### What tips do you have for other organizers?

Make sure to allot enough time to workshop/exploration/project time.  It's
crucial that hackers get enough time to play around with things, rather than
hearing a long lecture/introduction of concepts.
