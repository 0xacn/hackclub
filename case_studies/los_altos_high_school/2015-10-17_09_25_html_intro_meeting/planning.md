# Planning

## Outline

- Introduce Local Hack Day @ LAHS
- Introduce Silicon Valley Code Camp volunteer opportunity
- Go over what HTML is and how it used
- Go over our use of GitHub and Slack

## Problems

- Our workshop wasn't the most clear
- Some members seemed confused
- Club leader presenting wasn't loud enough and went really fast, and didn't
  explain the concepts very throughly
- Not enough time to go over everything - we had around 15 minutes to actually
  let them work, due to all the other stuff we had to mention

## Other Miscellaneous Planning

- Create a presentation to introduce GitHub, Slack, volunteer opportunities,
  hackathons, and HTML concepts
