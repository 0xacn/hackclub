## Objective

Bring up Los Altos Hacks (takes place on January 30-31), and if we want to
fundraise for it. They will have groups of 4 at Code Day. People who have
attended the most recent meeting will finish soccer. People that are new to the
club will start portfolio which I am familiar with, Leila will start some on
soccer while Jasmine will continue to help with any questions people have.

## How We Will Achieve This

We want to try out partner beginners with more advanced members so everyone can
help each other out. Leila will continue to work on the big screen so members
can follow along. Jasmine will help individually and I will help the beginners,
as well as take notes, which we are beginning to do this Thursday.
