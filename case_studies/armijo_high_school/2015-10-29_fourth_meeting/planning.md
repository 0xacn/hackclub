## Objective

Newcomers will sign up for Cloud Nine at c9.io. Members who already got up to
the point in the portfolio workshop where you enter a picture will move on to
the soccer workshop.

## How We Will Achieve This

The class will be separated into two groups of people who have been to one
meeting or less and people who have been to 2 or more. Leila is taking the ones
who have been members for longer and walking them through the Soccer workshop. I
will take any newcomers and set them up on c9 or help them with the Portfolio
workshop. Jasmine will be helping anyone who needs some kind of one on one
attention.

## Problems We Anticipate

We fear there may be a decrease in membership, due to lack of interest/sports.
The only other issue may be keeping everyone entertained because of the many
different levels.
