# Case Studies

This directory contains case studies of events from the [Labs](../meta/labs)
clubs and any others that choose to participate.

## Directory Structure

There is a directory for each club.

Here is what the directory structure looks like:

```
.
├── club_1
|   ├── event_a
|   |   ├── planning.md
|   |   └── post-mortem.md
|   ├── event_b
|   |   ├── planning.md
|   |   └── post-mortem.md
├── club_2
|...
```

Each club's directory contains sub-directories for each of the club's events (i.e
club fair, first club meeting, etc.)

Each event directory contains two files: [a planning document](#planning-document)
and [a post-mortem document](#post-mortem-document).

See the case studies section in
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md#case-studies) for a guide on submitting
case studies.

## Planning Document

The planning document, named `planning.md`, contains an outline of what's going
to happen at the event and any associated planning done to make that meeting
great.

## Post-mortem Document

The post-mortem document, named `post_mortem.md`, contains a reflection of each
meeting. Each post-mortem should answer the following questions:

- What you end up doing during the event and how did it differ from the original
  plan?
- What went well?
- What didn't go well?
- What tips do you have for other organizers?
  - _For example:_
    - Would you recommend doing or not doing what you did activity?
    - If you would recommend it, what might they watch out for?
    - etc.
