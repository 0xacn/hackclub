# Case Studies

This directory contains case studies of meetings from the [Labs](../meta/labs)
clubs and any others that choose to participate.

Each case study consists of two parts: the planning document and the post-mortem
document.

## Planning Document

The planning document, named `planning.md`, contains an outline of what's going
to happen at the meeting and any associated planning done to make that meeting
great.

## Post-mortem Document

The post-mortem document, named `post_mortem.md`, contains a reflection of each
meeting. Each post-mortem should answer the following questions:

- What were we planning on doing?
- What did we do?
- What went well?
- What didn't go well?
