# Feedback Forms

_This guide is a collection of info about feedback forms learned from
[Hack Camp](https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp)._

## Collecting Feedback

When giving the feedback forms to the hackers, it is very important that the
hackers feel that giving feedback is important. We don't want them to feel like
they're filling out the forms to appease us. Rather, we want them filling out
the forms because they want the club to be as good as possible and they know that
giving valuable feedback improves the club for everyone.

Making hackers feel like giving feedback is important can be broken down into
two parts:

1. Telling them why we want their feedback.
2. Actually acting on their feedback and showing that it makes a difference.

## Acting on Feedback

An important part to acting on feedback is making the changes visible to the
hackers. At Hack Camp we did this by announcing 1-2 noticeable pieces of
feedback we received at the previous meeting and explaining what we were doing
that meeting to act on that feedback.

## Getting First-Time Feedback

Getting feedback from a hacker for the first time is the hardest; they don't
have the previous experience of submitting feedback to build up a habit. This
can be fixed by having a focus on feedback at any meeting new hackers are
present.

For these all-important first-time meetings, the following can help:

1. Allocate a minimum of 10 minutes for feedback.
2. A quick explanation of why feedback is so important:

   > Hey everyone! We're going to send out a link to a feedback form for today.
   > We want to do everything we can to make this club as good as possible and
   > we can't do this without you.

   > Please be as harsh and critical as you feel comfortable, we are going to do
   > everything in our power to make this a great experience for each and every
   > one of you.

3. An announcement at the following meeting of 1-2 pieces of feedback you would
   like to highlight. ex.:

   > Hey everyone! Last meeting we got the feedback that people thought the room
   > was too dark, so today we will be keeping the window shades open.
