# Feedback Forms

_This guide is a collection of info about feedback forms learned from
[Hack Camp](https://github.com/hackclub/hack-camp)._

## Collecting Feedback

When giving the feedback forms to the hackers, it is very important that the
hackers feel that giving their feedback is important. Making hackers feel that
giving feedback is important can be broken down into two parts:

1. Telling them why we want their feedback.
2. Acting on hacker feedback in a way that is visible to hackers.

## Getting Hackers to Submit Feedback

Getting feedback from a hacker is hard; they don't think that submitting
feedback is worth their time. This can be fixed by showing the hackers what you
do in response to their feedback.

_It should be noted this is critically important in any meeting with a hacker
who is not yet in the habit of submitting feedback_

For increasing the submission rate of feedback in clubs, the following can help:

1. Allocate a minimum of 10 minutes for feedback.
2. A quick explanation of why feedback is so important:

   > Hey everyone! We're going to send out a link to a feedback form for today.
   > We want to do everything we can to make this club as good as possible and
   > we can't do this without you.

   > Please be as harsh and critical as you feel comfortable, we are going to do
   > everything in our power to make this a great experience for each and every
   > one of you.

3. An announcement at the following meeting of 1-2 pieces of feedback you would
   like to highlight. ex.:

   > Hey everyone! Last meeting we got the feedback that people thought the room
   > was too dark, so today we will be keeping the window shades open.
