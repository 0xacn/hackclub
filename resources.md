The ever important document that links to a wide variety of resources for learning

A note: if you're really committed to learning something, buy a book on it.
Just go to amazon and look for a high rated and recent (if that matters) book
on what you're looking for. Books may be more dull than online video courses
but they're much more effective if you can get through them.

List that's better than this one:
https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md

Intro to computer science courses. If you start one, don't stop and start
another, try to go through it no matter how tough it gets.

* cs50.tv is harvard's intro CS course. It uses scratch, linux (a virtual linux
  don't worry you won't be installing an OS on your computer), C throughout the
  first 3/4, and web languages for the last 1/4. cs50.net is the course's site.
* https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101 has a great intro course that uses
  Python.

  is MIT's intro CS class. It uses python.
* http://online.stanford.edu/course/programming-methodology is Stanford's intro
  CS class. It uses Java.
