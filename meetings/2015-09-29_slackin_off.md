## Primary Notes

- We're going to move forward with using Slack for our community
- Do we want cohort chats to be public or private?
  - Keep them private, as is. If they decide
- Who should be allowed in the Slack?
  - Everyone: Club Leaders + teams + members
    - We'll have private chats for our club leaders and labs leaders.
- Perhaps have people that are set explicitly as welcomers

## Additional Notes

1. Who should be allowed in the Slack
  1. Everyone -- Club Leaders + teams + members
  2. Club Leaders + Leadership teams
  3. Club Leaders we interface with only
  4. Labs Leaders only

Considerations:

- We get too much activity and Slack breaks:

My Thoughts:

- This is a good problem to have and we should cross that bridge when we get
  there.
- Though IRC has recently had more activity, I think shifting our cohort chats
  to Slack and even much of the Facebook hackEDU Leaders activity to Slack could
  be hugely beneficial to building the hackEDU community.

1. How do people get added?

2. How do people navigate to the Slack
  1. Slackin link should check if they are already authed and forward them to
     the Slack
