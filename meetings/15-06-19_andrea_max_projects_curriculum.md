Attendance: Andrea, Max

Need lesson plans to be specific:
* Instead of 'a day that people can practice and explore by themselves' define the constraints of the day well

Curriculum doesn't need to be our focus, solidifying knowledge should be
* 15 minutes of codecademy learning functions instead of building our own custom curriculum.
* Students who understand concepts explain it to students who don't, solidifying their knowledge.
* To solidify the introductory knowledge from other curriculums, students explore through individual projects.
* Individual projects help keep students interest and engagement.
* Pseudo-code is big for solidifying knowledge. (can be substituted by kinesthetic activities)

Projects (what is a project?)

1. Tests 
  * Very closed to exploration
1. Labs
  * Follows step by step curriculum, but open to exploration.
  * [Example labs](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B3W1S1znINJJZ2pIaThEUmV5clE&usp=sharing&tid=0B8egkDIZJzGSaFY2SVJxNnJaZ0U)
1. Make your own project (Very open ended)
  * Less guarantee of specific learning outcomes for hackers.
  * Hacker gains other knowledge on the side while working on projects.
Conclusions:
* Por que no los dos?
* We can have them work on their own projects and give them access to applicable labs.
* See ShibeSales (Max)

Homework (many implementations, this is just one possibility)
* Combines concepts together
* Much harder
* Analogous to exploration time in Hack Camp?
