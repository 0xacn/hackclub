Problems with Hack Camp and potential solutions

- Hack Camp is not a sustainable model; it reinvents the wheel by creating new
  curriculum
- Look into modifying current curriculum that does work

How do we test curriculum in larger batches/faster iterations?

- hackEDU Labs model (experienced hackEDU clubs)
- Club leaders getting budget to create and test ideas
- Close contact with club leaders to ensure constant data agregation
- Problem: code clubs that try something that fail will die off
- Problem: not enough current hackEDU clubs to iterate with this model

How to prevent the problems with hackEDU Labs model

- contact top 20 unaffiliated clubs
- finance them
- get data and experiementation results from them
- stop bootstraping new clubs

How to build up the club network

- conference calls
- quarterly retreat
