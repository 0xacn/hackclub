Attendees:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From now on, we hold these kanban truths to be self evident:

- All issues shall be followed through on by their creator (so if you make an
  issue, you better make sure it makes its way into the team queue or gets
  closed)
- This Week and Next Week shall be renamed to To Do and Backlog, respectively
- All issues in Backlog and To Do shall have an assignee
