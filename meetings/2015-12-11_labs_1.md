# Labs Meeting - 2015-12-11

*Present : Jevin, Vaibhav, Harrison, Lelia, Erina, Jasmine, Chaoyi, Selynna*

#### Cipher Problem: Getting People's Attention Outside of the Meeting Time

  - Erina + Lelia: Clubs are inside of school 
    - Usually just ask them during school
    - Help through Cloud9's online functionality
  - During the club: sign up for Slack + Remind
  - Harrison: Messenger chat for Facebook
    - 15 people in the club
    - Works since everyone is on Facebook at least a couple times a day

#### Cloud9 versus JS Bin

- Lelia: Cloud9 offers the functionality, long-term
  - Chat + sharing features
  - Git integration
- Harrison: JS Bin offers a simple solution to get rolling fast
  - Planning to move onto Cloud9
  - 30 to 45 minute meetings
    - No time to waste

#### Soccer Workshop

- Harrison: Flows well, but it is not written clearly enough
  - Some parts are dodgy (I see what you did there, Harrison -Jevin)
  - Feels kinda a draft
  - Definitely needs some work

#### Structuring of the Workshops

- Jevin: Doing something harder, then easier in a workshop
  - Having the feeling of, "Okay, I kind of get this," 
    - Then going into the excitement of knowing something 100%
    - This helps to engage the reader
- Erina + Lelia:  People like to see results!

#### Introduce each workshop with a presentation w/ key concepts

- Jevin: To combat the issue of confusion, **especially with JS**
  - PPTs that cover the complicated topics
    - Presenting it before diving into the workshop
  - Answer everyone's questions at once
  - Reassurance before starting the workshop
  - Will try this weekend at our meetup
- Udit: What they are about to learn, refer back to it before or after
- Erina: Important, refers back to notes on PPTs all the time personally

#### Keeping People Engaged

- Jevin: At the end of the club, talk about next club's content
- Harrison: Cool idea
  - They know they are building something really cool
  - Enticed to come back
    - "Make Minecraft" --> "Omg that's cool. I'm going to reach next week."

#### Cipher: 9 Doors Workshop

- Jevin: JavaScript is hard to understand compared to HTML + CSS
  - We need to compose smaller workshops
    - Smaller, digestible workshops with one/two key concepts
      - Tried to do this with the Thugify Workshop

#### Getting their work Online

- Jevin: Getting it online is important
  - Cool to see it online
    - You can have your own little part of the Internet
    - Easily share with friends and family
    - With Github Pages, it has your username in the URL, feels special
  - Need to prioritize time for this in workshops

#### Is it Difficult to Read Formatting  Markdown?

  - Jevin: Thinks the charts in the Cringe 101 Workshop are an important tool
  - Everyone: Good for the most part
    - Action: Add to Hack Club's resource.md:
      - https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links 

#### Getting Club Members in Hack Club Slack

- Lelia: What do you think of getting members on Hack Club Slack?
- Harrison: Do it!
  - Pro-Slack :)
  - Pro-IRC, but people don't know how to use it
    - Confusing, not as visually appealing as Slack
- Chaoyi: Likes IRC because it is made to manage channels
  - Very clear with a lot of people
- Jevin: It may be overwhelming
  - Solution: Have forewarning that there is lots of messages sent daily
- Udit: Make a channel called #hacks
  - Don't talk about coding terminology in #random, in #hacks
   - Tell members: Learn more about coding in #hacks
  - Jevin: Hack Club's Slack has a channel named #code
    - Perhaps utilizing this channel for this purpose would be good!
- Cipher: Bring it up and see what they thought
- Lelia: Talking to people with all types of experiences
- Jevin: Cool to talk to people from different areas of the world
- Selynna: Our members don't care too much about Slack
  - Not overwhelming
  - Just not applicable
- Takeaway: Let members know about the Slack + ability to join
  - Will not make it mandatory
