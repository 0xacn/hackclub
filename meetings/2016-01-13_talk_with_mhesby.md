## Call Notes

Here are the conclusions and hypotheses we made on the call:

### The Curriculum Arc is Important

Finishing the curriculum arc that outlines what concepts people will learn
when is extremely important because (1) you can make sure students know all the
dependencies for a new concept before introducing it (2) you can do proper
backwards planning to make sure you reach the learning objectives you wanted to
reach when the students finish all the workshops.

Finishing a full curriculum arc is a priority.

### Standardize The Workshop Format

Create 1-3 standardized formats that workshops are written in. For example,
there might be a workshop format that's geared towards building something
exciting as quickly as possible. Another format could be to convey more in depth
and is used to explain more conceptual things. This also allows:

- Jonathan to create workshops faster because he does not have to rethink how to
  structure the workshop every time he writes one.
- It becomes clear to other workshop contributors how to actually structure a
  workshop
- Club leaders can run workshops without having re-think how to deliver the
  workshop every time they run a workshop because it will be the same as last
  time.
- Club members to be able to do a workshop without having to spend time
  figuring out how they are going to navigate a workshop.

There should only be a maximum of 3 kinds of formats.

**Excitement Based Flow**

The Twilio workshop seems to have pretty good flow for getting to the exciting
parts of building cool things with it.

- Create a minimal boilerplate to run one Twilio function
- Show awesome examples of how else you can use the Twilio library
- Have a clear and concise documentation on how to use the Twilio library

### Have Explicit Directions

It seems from running the Twilio workshop that when we had just a bunch of
examples listed and we wanted them to do something with it, people didn't seem
to click through them. Instead of just having stuff that's listed, it may make
more sense to include an explicit direction like "Look through at least 1
example"

### You Can Include Additional Information Out of The Flow

There are many things that you want to include in the workshops, however,
instead of cramming them all in the main flow and forcing people to through it,
there are ways that you can take things out of the flow.

#### Glossary

Instead of spending lots of time explaining the details of what an API is, you
can make the word API clickable and have it redirect to a glossary that can
explain it a lot more. These can link to other learn to code resources like
[Free Code Camp](http://freecodecamp.com/).

#### Branching Off Workshops

In the Twilio Workshop, the example programs use some code from Giphy, something
that hackers are not likely to know.

The options are from least ideal to most ideal:

- Include documentation in the Twilio workshop for how to use Giphyâ€”but this is
  out of scope of the Twilio workshop and would make the Twilio workshop too
  large and unwieldy
- Just leave it in the example code with comments and they'll figure it out
- From the examples, indicate that we're using Giphy, something we haven't
  learned about yet. You can find out more about it by doing this Giphy
  workshop.

#### Learning Fundamental Concepts

Learning more about fundamental concepts is definitely useful but it can be
boring. Instead of trying to cram in too much of it in the linear flow of a
given workshop, instead you can (1) link to these resources on the glossary page
or (2) add the links to the bottom of a given workshop for where they can learn
more about the stuff in the workshop.

Moreover, it's not super concerning that they understand super deeply how
something works like callbacks until much later. It's that they need to
understand enough to be able to use it, not to construct an API in it.
