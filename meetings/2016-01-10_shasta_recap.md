- Zach Latta

_People in recap:_

- Jonathan Leung

## Bad

- _Announcements_
  - It wasn't always clear what Jonathan's intention was when speaking
  - Zach didn't have much emotion when speaking
  - It wasn't announced that it's okay to not have your product done when
    demoing
- _Workshop_
  - Using JS Bin instead of Cloud9 was very difficult
  - Whether or not people were pairing and how to pair program wasn't clear
    (when we told people they'd be demoing in their pairs, some seemed
    surprised because they'd been working independently)
  - People were struggling to run the examples
  - Hackers need separate Twilio accounts to receive text messages because
    phone numbers are shared across accounts.
  - Might be helpful to "brand" the demos (i.e. give them names and nice
    landing pages)
- _Demos_
  - Super unclear how to share from gist JS Bins (`File > Clone` then `File >
    Save Snapshot`)
  - We used email, which was very difficult to follow (because https://tlk.io
    was surprisingly blocked)
  - One person tried to demo the example project

## Good

- _Announcements_
  - We did a good job getting people's attention
  - Zach's demo was good, timing was potentially good (Matt said that he liked
    the timing)
- _Workshop_
  - Much clearer to follow than old iteration of the workshop, timing of it
    was good
  - People were into the GIF examples
- _Demos_
  - People felt comfortable demoing (high confidence, nobody asked if they
    have to demo)
