Attendence: Jonathan, Zach, Max

Objective
- create a system to create tasks for cohort 2

Water-fall was not working well from last week
- Just in time model for curriculum
- Curriculum can be much more distributed
- Not all members are able to cotribute as much as they would like
  - Perhaps @AndreaDeng hasn't had the opportunity to participate as much as she would like?
    - Specifically, our workflow is not transparent enough for all members of the organization
    - @MaxWofford will have a meeting for GitHub onboarding (might be useful to take notes on this for future onboarding)
  - @MaxWofford is potentially underutilized 

Actionable outcomes:
- Schedule meeting with @AndreaDeng for GitHub onboarding (@MaxWofford)
- 1-on-1 between @JonLeung and @ZachLatta about scheduling Friday meeting
- 1-on-1 between @MaxWofford and @ZachLatta about follow up from meeting
