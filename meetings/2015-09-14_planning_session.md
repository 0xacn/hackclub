## This Week

- [ ] Applicants
  - [ ] Get back to existing hackEDU applicants (@hellyeah)
    - I've created a working column in the Applicants spreadsheet
      - Legend:
        - WAITLIST :: Put at bottom of waitlist
        - WAITLIST ACCEPT :: Put them on the waitlist to be a hackEDU club
             starting next semester. Essentially a deferred acceptance.
        - WAITLIST INTERVIEW :: Say that you'll follow up with them next
             semester. Set a time to reach out and schedule a call where you can
             interview them again.
        - ACCEPT :: Accept them for this semester.
- [ ] Curriculum
  - [ ] Work with each club that has a meeting this week to plan for it
    (@jonleung)

      feedback form)
