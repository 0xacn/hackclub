Attendance: Jonathan, Zach, Max

feedback-session realizations:
- Instead of assigning tasks, everyone in the organizations creates issues.
- Brainstorming session with everyone creates tasks and filters issues into
  icebox, backlog, etc.
- People with specific role don't need to manage everything under their role,
  they are only responsible for it.

Actionable items:
- Breaking up tasks into github issues as a team activity tomorrow. (team)
