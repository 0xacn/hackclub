**** SF Schools (Max)

***** How to write it (Zach)
- One centralized playbook
  - Encourage people to write blog posts after every meeting
  - Have a section at the bottom of the playbook with a list of all blog posts
    - If a blog post is on Medium, syndicate it in the publication
    - If the blog post related to a specific section of the playbook, link it
      there as a case study.
