This meeting is to set our bi-monthly goals through the end of the semester.

## Semester Goal

- The playbook includes:
  - How to start a club
  - How to onboard into hackEDU
  - Workshops for 8 meetings
  - Suggested meeting format for 12 meetings

- We have a way that works to get meeting-to-meeting metrics (and eventually
  semester metrics)
- The playbook has a smooth UX and is accessible
