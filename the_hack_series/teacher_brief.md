Hello,

Thanks for being interested in "The Hack Series" by Hack Club. We're really
excited to have some of your students working with us this weekend.

Each day will consist of two sessions. The first will teach students how to
build their own personal websites and put them online for the world to see. The
second will teach students how to build a mobile app which can send do all
sorts of interesting tasks regarding websites.

We would really appreciate it if you could share the link to our website
(https://series.hackclub.io) to distribute around your school please let us
know. We will be doing a flier round tomorrow, if you would like a pack to
distribute around your school please let us know.

Thanks, Hack Club
