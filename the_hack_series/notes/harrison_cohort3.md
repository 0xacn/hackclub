# Notes

## Setup

- I feel really uncomfortable
- Music
  - Asked for music? What...
  - Way too loud
  - Doesn't seem prepared
  - Audio issues
- Social atmosphere feels forced
- Waiting on curriculum
- Everyone is sitting here doing other things
- Checkin
  - Maybe conversation could be had with co-leads
- Energizer 
  - Worked well
  - Tiny bit awkward for last person
  - But hey, thats what you get for being late

## Workshop Part 1

- Ambigous as to what I am supposed to be doing
- Some people were not connected to the internet
- Had to walk people through
- Great introduction by Zach
- No notification of demos
- Not good examples 
  - I wasn't excited
  - Literally did not care
  - Introducing
  - Alex did not seem confident
- I'm really happy we have that phone number on the door
- Probably saved us a bunch of issues
- Don't feel motivated to do things
- Why the fuck do I have to have `<p>` tags? What does this accomplish for me?
  - No visual difference
  - Possibly better to introduce after styling
  - > It doesn't look like much changed but it has!
    - No it hasn't... Nothing has changed
- > If we write out all the tags (don't bother doing this):
  - This doesn't seem to be a good idea
  - Don't tell stuff and then say it is unnesecary. I only want to know things
    that are important and applicable!
- Why do tags have to be closed?
- This `<oven>` thing seems irrelevant... It doesn't effect my website. Why am
  I doing it?
- In most cases, I want to actually have my image scale...
- We should make the WiFI stuff highlighted
- No explanation of what to do with non hosted images
  - I had to run people through setting up imgur
- Veronica is frustrated
  - Confused about html/css
  - Wants to use someone elses code
  - Alex doesn't seem to be letting her?
- We should link to http://subtlepatterns.com/
- Veronica doesn't know what to do when she has finished the tutorial
- Rachel is struggling with her non-square image
  - Confused "Why does this not look like Jonathans?"
- Did not _force_ people

## Demos

- Some people needed to speak up - Demo links were not too
- Wooohoo!
