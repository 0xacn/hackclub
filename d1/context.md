I'm going to touch on these things briefly, but we will revisit throughout

# Why

**Primary Objective**: To show people that there is the possibility of creating what *you* see missing in the world and thatyou don't have to break the rules.

There are 3 parts of this:

- designing who you are
- executing on the design
- not being afraid to break the rules

# How

Through explicit communication and through programming.

## knowing that it's possible
- Programming makes you realize that things are within your grasp
	- debugging
	- programming as magic
		- points
		- magic wand	
	- one of the most powerful vehicles, pharos
- Malleability
	- Jobs [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvEiSa6_EPA) | [Quote](http://www.brainpickings.org/2011/12/02/steve-jobs-1995-life-failure/)
	- Your abilities are malliable
	- The physical world around you is malleable
	- Your relationships are malleiabe
	- Your social constrants are malleabe
	- Your ideas on malleability are malleable

## designing who you are
- creating
- Bret Victor: Crafting a life thesis
	
## executing on the design
- Programming
	- Computational thinking
	- Malliability through making
	
## not being afraid to break the rules
- I'm afraid
	- things will break
	- afraid you'll get yelled at
	- you won't be liked
	- I'm afraid now as I share this with you because I'm not sure how it will be taken
- Overcoming Fear: "I have failed"
	- as we run this organization, we have failed a lot
	- I don't know lot's of things about programming
- Dare Greatly
- Mindset
	- Mathland / Frenchland / Programmingland
- This means tha you can mess with what we're thinking

## Concretize Themes

## as such, we are not your teachers
- While, you are here, you do not have to do anything
- Everything is just presented as an option
- We don't know that much
- I am not here to tell you the answers
- In tomorrow's society we will have companies that need you to figure it out
- This is only a 2 week experience, you must learn how to think
- It's not about getting the right answer
- It's about what you want to do
- I am not going to give you tests to grade you on.
