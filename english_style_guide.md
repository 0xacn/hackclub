# English Style Guidelines

This is an English style guide that Hack Club documentation should follow to
stay consistent in how we refer to common things.

## Terminology and Capitalization

### General Guides

**Company names** Company names are proper nouns and should be capitalized
according to how the company capitalizes it's name.

### List of Terminology

**club leader** Not _Hack Club leader_ or _club director_.

**console** Not _command line_, _command prompt_, or _terminal_.

**double-click** Not _double click_.

**filename**

**Hack Club**

**hacker**

**OK** Don't use _Okay_ or _Ok_.

**pop-up**

**right-click**

**URL**

## Punctuation

**All sentences should end with punctuation**, even if they end with
inline-code, a URL, or a filename.

_Example:_

_Correct: Go to https://google.com._

_Correct: Make sure the css selector is set to `#username`._

_Incorrect: This will save to `index.html`_

**Serial (Oxford) Commas**

For simplicity the final comma in a list of elements (usually the one before the
'and' or 'or') is left in the list.

## Other Style Guidelines

**bold** Titles that are to be omitted from a table of contents should be bolded
instead of added to a header. Usually, repeated titles should be bolded.

_Example:_

```
## Add an Image to The Website

We can add an image to the site with an `<img>` tag. Unlike `<p>` tags, `<img>`
tags don't have a closing tag.

**Our code so far:**
    <p>This is text</p>
    <img href="example.com/icon.png"></img>
```

**italicize** Anything that needs emphasis should be italicized.

**inline code**
Use the inline code style for any names directly used in code. _Don't_ use it
for any programming concept or programming related word not used in code.

_Example:_

_Correct:_ Create a new `<script>` tag.

_Incorrect:_ Run git push in the terminal to push our changes to GitHub.

_Incorrect:_ Each of the interactive elements on the page are called `sprites`.
