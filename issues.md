# Issues

By far our biggest issue is the lack of fun within clubs.

Why I enjoy programming:

* I can go from idea to implementation incredibly quickly.
  * Kind of goes back to that "builder's itch" that I get sometimes. That need
    to build something.
* It's an interesting mental challenge that produces tangible results.
* Above average intelligence and kindness in community.
