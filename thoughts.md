# Various Thoughts

**NOTICE**: This document is still in the works and is by no means official.

There is a generation of dedicated young people changing the world through
technology. This generation isn't going to wait for permission to spread their
message - they're already doing it

## The Name

* The potential negative connotation is intentional.
  * hackEDU is a movement driven by students.
  * We need to make the name informal to maintain that it's a student-driven movement.

## Ambassador Process

* Ambassador - someone who runs a hack club
* Certified ambassador - someone who runs an officially sponsored hack club and
  is certified to train other ambassadors.
  * Requirements:
    * 2 semesters of hack club
    * Trained one ambassador under supervision
    * 2 other certified ambassadors vouch for them

## Onboarding Process

1. Must meet minimum qualifications.
  * One major coding project
  * Display of leadership skills
  * (look at the YC app for the types of questions to ask, esp the one about
    hacking the world)
2. Meeting with certified ambassador.
3. Training.

## Types of People Learning to Program

* Takes initial initiative, but doesn't go anywhere with it. "Okay, I
  learned the basics of programming, I have a new skills, now what?"
  * Show what's possible.
* People who want to learn, but never take initiative. The type of person who
  has a Codecademy account and works through it, but never goes anywhere with
  it.
  * Needs someone to help them take initiative and actually build things.
