# Various Thoughts

There is a generation of dedicated young people changing the world through
technology. This generation isn't going to wait for permission to spread their
message - they're already doing it

## Ambassador Process

* Ambassador - someone who runs a hack club
* Certified ambassador - someone who runs an officially sponsored hack club and
  is certified to train other ambassadors.
  * Requirements:
    * 2 semesters of hack club
    * Trained one ambassador under supervision
    * 2 other certified ambassadors vouch for them

## Onboarding Process

1. Must meet minimum qualifications.
  * One major coding project
  * Display of leadership skills
  * (look at the YC app for the types of questions to ask, esp the one about
    hacking the world)
2. Meeting with certified ambassador.
3. Training.
