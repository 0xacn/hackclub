# Notes from Lunch with Jeremy

- **Primary realization:** we have not been spending enough time actually doing
  the change we care about.
  - Instead, we have been trying to set up the right systems to enable that
    change to happen.
    - This doesn't translate because we're dumb and can't predict well.
      - Instead, we should ship to our customers to advance our key metric
        - The defined key metric and customers do not have to be perfect and we
          can iterate on them.
- Keep the goal of the club uniform
  - Coding is the vehicle of innovation that we are promoting
- We are spending too much time focusing on semantics.
  - May or may not be bad, but that bad thing is that we're spending too much
    time.
- Externally, be very specific with the actionable what.
  - Philosophy is not one of these things
- Parallel universe theory
  - In a parellel universe, if I did another thing, which universe would turn
    out better?
- Questions to investigate
  - Why do clubs fizzle?
    - Some clubs die off and are started by other students later.
      - The past leader left
    - The organizer doesn't feel ownership.
      - The club stops meeting
      - Members stop feeling engaged
      - Organizer doesn't care
- Create a club in a box because students are busy
  - How do we make things so easy for the club organizer to do (like starting
    off new programmers), while still having the organizer feel ownership
- Down the road
  - Is AP CS a variable deciding whether or not to work at a school
- Major major major blocking problem
  - **Jeremy has never seen a program that successfully takes people with no
    coding experience (and not self teachers already) to having 25% of them
    building projects outside of class**
- Have guided projects for beginners
  - Have a really fucking clear guide so they can reference it later when
    they're building their own project
  - Hypothesis: have people build really great guides
  - Copying and pasting old code is a great learning tool
