# Iterating on Our Key Metric

After talking with Jeremy yesterday, we realized that we're spending too much
time thinking in the abstract and not actually executing. This all changes now.

For now, we've set our key metric as the median number of projects shipped per
student in hackEDU clubs.

We're currently blocking on not having enough data about the members of our
clubs. Specifically, we need to get their emails so we can reach out to them
directly and find them on other services, like GitHub and Facebook. 

We hypothesis that getting this information will help us establish the base
case of our key metric and give us ground to iterate on.
