This document outlines who we think about or organization. We being members and
organizers of hackEDU.

We need a

lot of extra space here

so we can fit

the one and only

maybe some actual content can go here someday.

## People

## Funnel

1. Potential Members
2. Members
3. Organizers

### Target New Members

- 1st and 2nd year high school students
- who are interested in creating things
- of or relating to Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM)

### Members

- Members of the hackEDU family make things outside of school classes (a proxy
  for things that they are excited about) with programming.

### Organizers

- most likely 2nd and 3rd year high school students 
- who are evangelists for learning to code
- has created more than 1 project before

Segmentation

- who have an existing club
- who want to start a new club

### Alums

- 4th year high school students

### Mission

- hackEDU empowers 1st and 2nd year high school students to build things they
  care about with code. We do this by helping to create, connect, and grow
  closely knit student-run coding clubs in high schools.

### Key Mey Metric

- number of programming projects per person built outside of class.

#### Causal

**Don't Panic**

**Radical Inclusion**
- anyone is welcome to come to the club
- beginners are welcome
	* no one makes anyone feel bad for saying
	* there are no outcasts 	
	
**Celebrating Not Knowing**
Straight from Hacker Schools Website:

> We think this is one of the most pernicious impediments to education. In most
> of the world, but especially school and work, people are afraid of looking
> stupid. This fear frequently keeps us from asking important questions like
> "how does that work?" or even just "why?" Worse, it keeps us from saying "I
> don't understand." That means many of us muddle on with a half-baked or
> entirely incorrect understanding of core concepts. This is particularly bad
> with programming, because these misunderstandings compound, and over time
> become harder and more embarrassing to admit to and address.

> someone else to help you with it (or vise versa).

**Help Others**

**Radical Openness**

**Active Participation**

**Active Collaboration**

**Problem in HS people don't reall yknow what they're doing, let's just make
things and you'll eventually figure it out**

#### Result

**Safety**

### Sorted List Of Assumptions, Biggest and Most Important Assumption At Top

- By first identifying which clubs have the most projects produced and then
  spreading their knowledge and expertise to other club organizers and then to
  members, we can increase the number of projects built by those clubs.
- 1st and 2nd year high school students will more readily join clubs than 3rd
  and 4th years. Measurability: when spending the same amount effort, more 1st
  and 2nd years join than 3rd or 4th years.
- Having 1st and 2nd year high school organizers join clubs will allow them to
  take on leadership positions later in the club.
