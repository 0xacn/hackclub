    * US First Notes: https://workflowy.com/#/8e2c4bc70f0b
* Requirements
  "note this is not the best practices doc because this has not been tested"
  * How this guide should be designed?
    * With as little words as possible.
    * Very easy to understand.
    * Have a super short video when it is easier to explain a concept.
    * Should be editable by everyone.
    * Should be built for experimentation
    * Should almost be checklist like
    * Should not be like the Transformative Action Institute guide where it is super intimidating.
    * Should start off with the lowest hanging g first where the club organizer can experiance small wins so they going.
    * It should be broken down into manageble time chunks, i.e. only do x thing provides a smal win .
    * Should not be a static experience
    * Should feel that they can communicate with any of the other club organizers very quickly
      * Sidebar with IRC on website?
    * Really easy collaboration system
    * People should be asking "how can i help other people more?"
    * Philosophy of how learning happens and how communities are created should be clearly conveyed. Should also reference specific experiences, such as an in-person retreat, that have happened with us.
    * Meetings with organizers are as much about what's going on and seeing if things are going well as well as they are modeling culture
      * We really want our organizers to realize the value of culture
    * The document should be as user-generated as possible
      * Maybe we shouldn't even write anything and everything written can be traced to a club organizer.
        * At the end of the day everyone wants the same thing.
      * Could write the documentation right when we're having calls and commit them immediately (even if what we wrote is bad).
      * Could source all of the answers directly from club organizers.
    * Should be really well branded.
    * Should not be 
    * Should be really explicit about culture and vocabulary.
    * There should be a story and a narrative.
    * Should be an objective section with objectives for clubs sourced from club organizers
      * Answers that align with our philosophy will be sourced as a seed
      * We should be clear that these are not the objectives of hackEDU, but rather the objectives of the leaders of the clubs in hackEDU. Everyone can have their own objectives that aren't necessarily these, but these act as a general guideline.
    * Think about as many ways as possible to not write the culture, but to model it #cupcakes.
    * Have the culture of what you want to do.
      * Us -> Organizer
        * What do you want to do?
        * I want to do x.
        * Great, go do x. How can we be helpful when you're doing x?
      * Be explicit with the organizer that we are doing this, so they can do the same thing with the students in their club.
    * Notice any time that we're channeling information from one club to another.
      * Although we can facilitate the transfer of information from one club to another, we should never do this.
      * We should use what we're transferring to create questions and use what we would transfer as a sourced answer.
    * Have each organizer create a family name for their club
      * Model this by calling it the hackEDU family
    * When we divide groups into regions, have them devise their own family name that's internal to those organizers.
  * Make sure you have someone to take over
* Specific Vocabulary
* Culture
* Objective Setting
  * So why are you starting it
  * What is the objective
* Members
  * Have people from multiple grades
