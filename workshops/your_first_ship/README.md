The goal of this workshop is as an add on to any other workshop. It'll run members through joining the Slack and making a ship! It's a great way to mix up a club meeting and bring club members into the Slack community. It's a slideshow you can load up through the web. 

It covers the following five steps:

1. Joining the Slack
2. Meeting Clippy & going through the onboarding
3. Finding the Ship Channel
4. Introducing Your Project
5. Shipping!

It's fairly simple and you can run through it in around 10 minutes.

## Preparing for the workshop

To prepare for the workshop the best thing to do is to familiarise yourself with the Slack joining process. Try going to https://hackclub.com/slack and making a dummy account to get a feel for it or run `/restart` to go through the Slack onboarding with Clippy. 

## Club Channels

You can customise the flow by having members be invited to your very own club channel! To get your custom link run `/slack-invite` on the Hack Club Slack as a leader and then the link will be at the end of the message.
