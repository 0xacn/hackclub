# Loops

Here's a quick example loop:

```js
console.log('The loop will start soon')

var i = 0;
while (i < 3) {
  console.log('The number is ' + i);
  i++
}

console.log('The loop finished')
```

This code will output the following message in your console:

> The loop will start soon  
> The number is 0  
> The number is 1  
> The number is 2  
> The loop finished
