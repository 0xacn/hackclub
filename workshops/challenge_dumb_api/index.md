# Dumb API Challenge

_This is an introduction to the July 2018 challenge we’re running. [Submit your projects here!](https://hackclub.com/challenge)_

The prompt for this challenge is to create the dumbest/silliest API possible. An API is a web project that returns a response, usually dependent on some sort of query/input.

For example, you can go to https://api.hackclub.com/v1/challenges to see all of Hack Club’s Challenges. 

## Examples

* GitHub Zen: go to https://api.github.com/zen and you’ll get a piece of advice. Reload for another randomly-decided line.
* Hypochondriapp: not an API, but same idea. Go to http://hypochondriapp.io/ and get the worst possible disease you could have from a symptom.

The challenge is to create the API, but you are more than welcome to create an application like Hypochrondriapp that demonstrates your API.

## Getting started

Here are a few tutorials for getting started:

* [Using Python and Heroku](https://spapas.github.io/2014/06/30/rest-flask-mongodb-heroku/)
* [Using Node.js and MongoDB](https://hackernoon.com/restful-api-design-with-node-js-26ccf66eab09)
* [Using Ruby and Sinatra](https://x-team.com/blog/how-to-create-a-ruby-api-with-sinatra/)

## Before you go…
