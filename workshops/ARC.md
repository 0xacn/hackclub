# Workshops Arc

This document outlines our curriculum arc. In many ways, this is the syllabus
for Hack Club.

Hack Clubs are after-school high school clubs where people build things
together. They can almost be thought of as never-ending hackathons, where club
members come together twice a week (generally for ~1.5 hours) and work on
projects together. Throughout the school year, Hack Clubs go (and sometimes
host) hackathons, work on larger group projects, and---most importantly---build
a thriving community of hackers at their high schools.

While the goal with Hack Clubs is for most meetings to be free-form time where
hackers are working on projects together, we're actively developing a series of
open-source workshops to bring members from no experience to the point where
they can hack on projects.

Hackers use the following tools for workshops:

- [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) - development environment
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - code host
  - All Hack Club development goes into a
    [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) repository called
    `[username].github.io` (replacing `[username]` with their GitHub username)
  - Each project done in Hack Club (so at least each workshop) goes into a
    sub-directory called `project_name` in the main `[username].github.io`
    project. The hackers should be regularly committing and pushing. For
    example, if I were doing the Portfolio workshop, I'd put my work in
    `[username].github.io/portfolio/`.

Below is the initial plan for the Hack Club workshop progression. The `Week #`
column is the week since the club's first meeting that the concept and workshop
should be run. `Meeting #` is the meeting that it should be run in. It assumes
that meetings happen twice a week and that every other meeting is free-form time
for hacking.
