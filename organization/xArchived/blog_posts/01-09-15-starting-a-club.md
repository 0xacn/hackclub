# Starting a Club

At hackEDU our goal is to build the easiest way to start and lead successful
programming clubs at high schools because we believe that programming changes
lives. It seems blatantly obvious in hindsight, but we should probably know how
to start and lead successful programming clubs at high schools if we want to do
that, so we've decided to actually start one (or a few) programming clubs at
high schools in San Francisco.

So far we've contacted Lowell High School, Galileo High School, John O'Connell
High School, and Abraham Lincoln High School. We're waiting on Lowell to set a
date and time for the club organization meeting to plan for this upcoming
semester. We sent Galileo an email and are waiting for a response. John
O'Connell was very receptive to the idea and they're setting a date for next
week to have a meeting with students and teachers at the school involved in
technology. Lincoln was also very receptive to the idea and the teacher who
leads their technology academy will get back to us with next steps.

The plan moving forward is to finally have a first meeting at one of these
schools and record all of our progress running the club to share with our
organizers. Running a club on our own very explicitly makes us peers of our
club organizers instead of supervisors, which we're hoping will help build
community and an environment where everyone contributes.
