# Values at hackEDU



## Our values are very important to us.



## We have 4 primary values: 1. Integrity 2. Curiosity 3. Authenticity 4.
Transparency



# 1. Integrity



## Integrity When we say that we're going to do something, we do it.



As soon as you commit to something, people are relying you to do it.

That's why it's important to keep your word.



### By keeping our commitments we can become more effective because the people
we work with know what to expect from us.




## But we aren't perfect There will be many times where you commit to something
but something comes up.



## This happens!

## It's O.K.!



The expectation is that as soon as you know you can't do something, your job is
to let people know.




## A Note About Integrity We don't use integrity in the moral sense. We don't
believe that there is anything inherently wrong with not keeping your word, it
just makes us less effective.

It's more like the integrity of the hull of ship: if it's breached, the ship
isn't a very effective mode of transport.



## Pro-Tip #1: Be Clear Be specific about what you are committing to.

Instead of saying:

> I will finish the lesson

try being more specific and say:

> I will finish the lesson by preparing the slidedeck and sample projects and
> put it in a Github repo that I will send to you on IRC by Thursday evening.



## Pro-Tip #2: Undercommit To make sure you can fulfill your commitments, it's
easier if you have less of them.

So instead of saying "yes" to everything, if you are not sure, be on the safe
side and don't commit to doing it.

Don't be afraid to say no. It's hard a lot of times to say no, but know that it
pays off in the long term.



## Pre-Tip #3: Know there's no shame saying know to things.

I (Jonathan) sometimes feel that if I can't do something important, it means
that I'm not good enough. I have to remind myself that this is not true.


Try not to tie your self worth into how much you can do. You are good enough.
Don't shame yourself for not being able to say yes to everything.


If you try to please everyone, you'll please no one.



## Pro-Tip #4: Don't pressure other's to commit

On the flip side of this, don't pressure someone into commiting to do something
or else they will feel shame, perhaps commit to it, and not being able to follow
through with it.




## Pro-Tip #5: Know It's Hard Keeping your word is hard. Many times you'll have
to stay up and go all in and work really hard on the things that you've
committed to.



# 2. Curiosity When you're curious, you aren't attached to being right. When
you're talking with someone else, you listen to what the other person is saying
and let go of your perspective of the situation while they're talking.



## This is REALLY hard.



## Signs that you're NOT being curious

1. Immediately saying, "I don't think that's right..." 2. While the other person
is talking, interjecting "Well, actually..." to correct a minor point 3. You're
thinking of what you're saying while the other person is talking



## Signs tha you're being curious

1. You ask "Oh, why do you think X" and actually caring 2. Going deeper and
asking "why several more times."



## Taken Directly from HopeLab:

We create stories in our heads to make sense of the world around us. In the
absence of curiosity, our stories rule us, blinding us to other possibilities,
other interpretations of our experiences. For instance:

> I wake in the middle of the night to a dog barking furiously in my
> neighborhood. I lie awake for hours listening to the barking, vacillating
> between aggravation and worry. What is going on? I finally call the police and
> report the disturbance. Moments later, the barking stops – silence at last! –
> and I hear someone knocking at my front door. I open the door to find a police
> officer with my dog. Both look exasperated. It was my dog barking,
> accidentally locked out of the house for the night. I’m mortified. It never
> once occurred to me the barking dog could be mine.

Getting curious can illuminate alternative explanations, expand our vision, and
reveal other choices available to us. Curiosity can also save us from
embarrassing encounters with the police.



## 3. Authenticity

Speak directly what is true for you without trying to manipulate the outcome.
You can let go of trying to engineer what you're saying to protect others or
yourself.

Be direct about your intention and what you're feeling.



If they're's a problem or if you have a need that's not met, make sure you speak
up and let the appropriate person know or else they won't be able to help you!



Make sure that you're saying  - what is true for you, not the other person
(because you don't necessarily know what may be true for the other person). -
speaking objectively instead of in absolutes

For example, saying that

> You're always late and so I feel that you don't respect me.

Notice that "You're always late" is an absolute. Instead, you can be more
objecive by saying: > When you came in late in the last two club meetings...

Notice that "you don't respect me" is not your feeling. It is what *you think*
someone else is feeling. Instead, try saying something that's true for you:

  "It makes me feel sad because I don't know how to productively fill the time
  "while I'm waiting and it makes me uneasy when I don't know if we can finish
  "the meeting on time or if we can cover everything we need to."
